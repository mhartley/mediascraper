Although appointed by Barack Obama in 2009, Bharara made his name in the US's preeminent prosecutor's office with a series of corruption investigations of Democrats and Republicans alike, as well as high-profile cases on insider trading, terrorism, espionage and gangs. Unlike Sally Yates, the acting attorney general fired by Trump because she refused to defend one of his executive orders in court, Bharara's surprise dismissal followed an apparent truce between the president and the prosecutor. Last year, Bharara met with Trump and Sessions as they transitioned into office, and said he was asked to stay on in service in New York.

After a Seattle judge issued a temporary restraining order against the ban on Friday night, Trump, true to form, used Twitter to attack the judge and complain about the ruling. Some observers, and quite a few senior Democrats, said such behavior, and any government move to appeal the Seattle ruling, could precipitate full-blown constitutional crisis. Trump issued his tweets from Mar-a-Lago, his so-called \u201cwinter White House\u201d in Florida.
