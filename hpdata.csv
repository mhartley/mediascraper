He confirmed to Yahoo News that he was questioned for more than two hours on Sept. 1 by an FBI agent and a Justice Department national security lawyer at the bureau\u2019s Washington field office.</p>, <p>Feinberg said the interview was focused on Sputnik\u2019s \u201cinternal structure, editorial processes and funding.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThey wanted to know where did my orders come from and if I ever got any direction from Moscow,\u201d Feinberg told Yahoo News. \u201cThey were interested in examples of how I was steered towards covering certain issues.\u201d</p>, <p>It is not clear whether the agent and prosecutor who questioned Feinberg were acting as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s broader investigation into Russian efforts to disrupt the 2016 election and possible links to the Trump campaign. \u201cWe are not confirming whether specific matters are or are not part of our ongoing investigation,\u201d a spokesman for Mueller emailed. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment, and the FBI did not respond to questions.</p>, <p>But the inquiry comes at a time when members of Congress and others have pushed the Justice Department to strengthen its enforcement of the FARA, especially as it relates to the operations in Washington of two Russian news organizations, Sputnik and RT (formerly known as Russia Today).</p>, <p>\u201cThis is incredibly significant,\u201d said Asha Rangappa, a former FBI counterintelligence agent and now an associate dean of Yale Law School, about the bureau\u2019s questioning of the former Sputnik reporter. \u201cThe FBI has since the 1970s taken pains not to be perceived in any way as infringing on First Amendment activity. But this tells me they have good information and intelligence that these organizations have been acting on behalf of the Kremlin and that there\u2019s a direct line between them and the [Russian influence operations] that are a significant threat to our democracy.\u201d</p>, <p>Sputnik is owned by Rossiya Segodnya, a Russian government media operation headed by Dmitri Kiselyov, a belligerent television broadcaster who is\xa0<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-media-kiselyov-propagandist/25195932.html">known as Putin\u2019s \u201cpersonal propagandist\u201d</a>\xa0and has been sanctioned by the European Union in response to Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine. On its website, Sputnik\xa0<a href="https://sputniknews.com/docs/about/index.html">describes itself</a>\xa0as a \u201cmodern news agency\u201d that \u201ccovers global political and economic news targeting an international audience.\u201d</p>, <p>Contacted by Yahoo News, Sputnik\u2019s U.S. editor in chief, Mindia Gavasheli, said, \u201cAny assertion that we are not a news organization is simply false.\u201d He also said he was unaware of the FBI probe. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m hearing about it, and I don\u2019t think anyone at Sputnik was contacted, so thank you for letting us know,\u201d Gavasheli said.</p>, <p>Gavasheli attributed the push to have Sputnik register through FARA to paranoia surrounding Russia. \u201cI think it tells about the atmosphere of hysteria that we are witnessing now,\u201d Gavasheli said. \u201cAnything being related to Russia right now is being considered a spycraft of some sort.\u201d</p>, <p>Both Sputnik and RT were identified in a U.S. intelligence report in January as being arms of Russia\u2019s \u201cstate-run propaganda machine\u201d that served as a \u201cplatform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.\u201d As an example, the report said, Sputnik and RT \u201cconsistently cast President-elect Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional US media outlets that they claimed were subservient to a corrupt political establishment.\u201d</p>, <p>The investigation appears to center on whether Sputnik should be covered by the foreign agents registration law, a 1938 act passed by Congress to combat Nazi propaganda. The law mandates that foreign entities seeking to influence American public opinion and engage in lobbying must file detailed reports with the Justice Department on their funding and operations. If the Justice Department concludes that Sputnik is covered by the law, its executives in the U.S. could face criminal charges and fines, while the news agency\u2019s reports would have to be explicitly labeled as foreign propaganda rather than presented as news.</p>, <p>There is an exemption under the law for media organizations that engage in legitimate news-gathering activity. But Feinberg, the former Sputnik reporter, said the FBI agent and Justice prosecutor who interviewed him focused their questions on how Sputnik determined what stories it would cover, where its directions came from and what he knew about its sources of funding.</p>, <p>(Yahoo first learned about the FBI inquiry from a U.S. intelligence source. Feinberg then confirmed he was interviewed and showed the business cards of the FBI agent and Justice Department lawyer who questioned him.)</p>, <p>While his instructions as White House correspondent came from the senior editors and news directors at Sputnik\u2019s Washington office, Feinberg said these supervisors regularly \u201cwould say, \u2018Moscow wants this or Moscow wants that.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>The thumb drive of emails and other documents that Feinberg turned over to the FBI contains messages that could shed light on Sputnik\u2019s funding, its operations in Washington and how it makes editorial decisions. It includes documents Feinberg submitted on behalf of Sputnik to obtain congressional press credentials in which he confirmed that the Russian government is the company\u2019s main funding source.</p>, <p>The questioning of Feinberg, Sputnik\u2019s former White House correspondent,\xa0came just two weeks\xa0<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/reporter-says-state-run-russian-propaganda-outlet-pushed-cover-seth-rich-conspiracy-theory-center-new-white-house-lawsuit-000407907.html">after Yahoo News published an interview</a>\xa0in which he claimed he was fired by Sputnik\u2019s D.C. bureau chief for refusing orders to ask the president\u2019s press secretary about a since-discredited Fox News report in a televised briefing. That report claimed that WikiLeaks obtained internal Democratic National Committee emails not from material hacked by Russian intelligence services, as the U.S. government has asserted, but from a low-level DNC staffer, Seth Rich, who was murdered on the streets of Washington in July 2016. (Fox has since retracted the report.)</p>, <p>Feinberg, who first made his allegations on May 26, the day he left Sputnik, has also claimed the company pushed him to ask questions that suggested the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad, who is a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was not behind chemical attacks in that country. Feinberg said the interviewers specifically asked him about\xa0<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/21/russian-propaganda-sputnik-reporter-215511">a piece he wrote detailing these claims</a>\xa0that was published by Politico on Aug. 21. A spokeswoman for Sputnik has previously denied Feinberg\u2019s allegations and told Yahoo News his contract with the company \u201cwas not renewed due to performance-related issues.\u201d</p>, <p>The FBI reached out to Feinberg shortly after another former Sputnik staffer, Joseph John Fionda, sent a letter to the Justice Department\u2019s national security division detailing a series of similar accusations against the news organization and requested that it be investigated for FARA violations.</p>, <p>In a brief conversation over an encrypted messaging app, Fionda told Yahoo News he also sent \u201ca big packet\u201d of information to the division on or about Aug. 15.</p>, <p>In his letter to Justice, Fionda\xa0 said he was employed by RIA Global LLC, a media company associated with Sputnik, from Sept. 5 to Oct. 19, 2015. During that time, Fionda wrote, Sputnik conducted \u201ca perception management information warfare program\u201d about Russia\u2019s military involvement in Syria. He said the news organization falsely described Russia\u2019s targets in that country as \u201cterrorists\u201d affiliated with the jihadist group ISIS when, he asserted, the Russian forces were actually bombing other anti-Assad rebel groups.</p>, <p>In another instance, Fionda said, an article he wrote in September 2015 about President Obama\u2019s repatriation of Guant\xe1namo detainees to a number of countries was \u201ccensored\u201d to omit any reference to the fact that six of the detainees were being sent back to Russia, where they were later imprisoned.</p>, <p>Fionda said his last straw with Sputnik came on Oct. 19, 2015, after excerpts of private emails from then-CIA Director John Brennan were published by a hacker on Twitter. He claimed Gavasheli, Sputnik\u2019s U.S. editor in chief, asked him to \u201cobtain the CIA Director\u2019s stolen emails\u201d from the hacker.</p>, <p>\u201cI refused because I believed this was a solicitation to espionage,\u201d Fionda wrote.</p>, <p>When he refused the order, Fionda wrote that Gavasheli told him to \u201cget the f\u2014 out of my office\u201d and then fired him. Gavasheli, in his interview with Yahoo News, denied this and said Fionda was fired after falsely claiming his father was ill in order to take time off from work.</p>, <p>The probe into Sputnik also comes shortly after the Russian news agency announced a significant expansion in the U.S. capital: It\xa0<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/im-sure-youve-heard-a-lot-about-us-russia-funded-radio-broadcasts-blocks-from-the-white-house/2017/07/12/a5813f1c-6660-11e7-a85a-668d1feaf231_story.html?utm_term=.ae8bd65142a5">took over a popular Washington FM radio station</a>\xa0dedicated to playing bluegrass music and replaced it with an all-talk format with hosts who regularly criticize U.S. policies\xa0\u2014 as well as one co-host who is a former Breitbart News reporter and Trump supporter. \u201cI\u2019m sure you heard a lot about us,\u201d Gavasheli was quoted as saying by the Washington Post. \u201cNow you can actually listen to us.\u201d</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><em><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/sputnik-russian-news-agency-investigation-fbi-090024231.html" target="_blank">This story was originally published on Yahoo News.</a></em></p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><strong>Read more from Yahoo News:</strong></p>, <p>\u2022<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/fire-facebook-refuses-disclose-political-ads-bought-russian-trolls-230143492.html">Under fire, Facebook refuses to disclose political ads bought by Russian trolls</a></p>, <p>\u2022<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/clinton-2016-flagrantly-sexist-candidate-won-132321472.html">Clinton on 2016: \u2018The flagrantly sexist candidate won\u2019</a></p>, <p>\u2022<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/ahead-911-top-trump-aide-says-u-s-not-vulnerable-terrorists-193100093.html">Ahead of 9/11, top Trump aide says U.S. not vulnerable to terrorists</a></p>, <p>\u2022<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/dreamers-gave-personal-data-daca-now-wonder-will-u-s-use-deport-204512167.html">\u2018DREAMers\u2019 gave up their personal info for DACA.

Kennedy\u2019s action gives the full Supreme Court time to consider the merits of the Trump administration\u2019s emergency request in full. Kennedy asked refugee ban challengers to file a response by noon (1600 GMT) on Tuesday.</p>, <p>The administration did not ask the court to put on hold a separate part of the lower court ruling that exempted grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents from Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries.</p>, <p>In the court filing, the Justice Department said the 9th Circuit\u2019s decision on the refugee ban \u201cwill disrupt the status quo and frustrate orderly implementation of the order\u2019s refugee provisions.\u201d Up to 24,000 additional refugees would become eligible to enter the country than would be otherwise allowed, according to the administration.</p>, <p>The Justice Department\u2019s filing marked the latest twist in the ongoing legal fight over Trump\u2019s sweeping March 6 executive order that barred travelers from Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days, a move Trump argued was needed to prevent terrorist attacks. The same order included a 120-day ban on refugees from around the world.</p>, <p>The bans were challenged by Hawaii and other Democratic-led states, the American Civil Liberties Union and refugee groups.</p>, <p>Both provisions were blocked by lower courts but were partially revived by the Supreme Court in June, which said the bans could be applied only to people without a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship to people or entities in the United States.</p>, <p>That prompted new litigation brought by Hawaii over the meaning of that phrase, including whether written assurances by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees would count as a bona fide relationship.</p>, <p>The Trump administration said the assurances should not, meaning such refugees would be barred.</p>, <p>The appeals court also said his administration did not persuasively explain why the broader travel ban should be enforced against close relatives of people from the six specified countries. The Justice Department said in its filing on Monday it disagreed with that part of the decision but was not seeking to block it from going into effect.</p>, <p>The broader question of whether the travel ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution, as lower courts previously ruled, will be considered by the Supreme Court in October.</p>, <p>States, civil liberties advocates and others who challenged Trump\u2019s order in court argued that it violated federal immigration law and the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. Critics called it a discriminatory \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s March order replaced a broader January one that was blocked by federal courts.</p>, <p>(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)</p>, <p><em>This story has been updated with the Supreme Court\u2019s response.</em></p>]

It will be guerilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy.\u201d</span></em></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson wrote that the United States is \u201cgoing to punish somebody for this attack, but just who or what will be blown to smithereens for it is hard to say.\u201d</span></p>, <p>He continued:</p>, <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cMaybe Afghanistan, maybe Pakistan or Iraq, or possibly all three at once.

Bush would react to the attack and how his decisions would affect the lives of everyday Americans.</p>, <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis is going to be a very expensive war, and Victory is not guaranteed \u2015 for anyone, and certainly not for anyone as baffled as George W.

Critics have expressed considerable alarm at the presence of certain panelists, particularly Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell (R), as well as former Justice Department officials Hans von Spakovsky and J. Christian Adams,\xa0because all four have a history of pushing more restrictive voting measures.</p>, <p>An <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-nvra_us_59698037e4b017418627ac98">email made public</a> as part of a separate ongoing lawsuit against Kobach shows he was writing a draft of an amendment to federal voting law to make it permissible for states to impose a proof of citizenship requirement to register to vote.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tuesday meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, will be divided into <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-updated-meeting-agenda-09122017.pdf" target="_blank">three panels</a>\xa0focusing on voter turnout, public confidence in elections and electronic voting systems, respectively. \xa0Some of the scheduled presentations look to paint a picture of an American election system that is ripe for voter fraud, even though <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/debunking-voter-fraud-myth" target="_blank">several studies and investigations</a> have shown it is not a widespread problem.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One presentation submitted to the commission around<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-govt-accountability-institute-problem-duplicate-voting.pdf" target="_blank">\xa08,500 likely duplicate votes </a>across 21 states. Unable to access data from all 50 states, the researchers extrapolate their findings to estimate that there are at least 45,000 instances of double voting across the country, a number still considerably short of the three to five million people Trump has alleged voted illegally last year. Those conducting the analysis compared voters\u2019 first names, last names, dates of birth and the first five digits of their social security numbers, but other studies have also shown<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/07/27/pences-voter-fraud-commission-will-almost-certainly-find-thousands-of-duplicate-registrations-that-arent-duplicates-heres-why/?utm_term=.8f2b79be2c3f" target="_blank"> it\u2019s extremely easy</a> to get false positives when comparing voter data.\xa0</span></p>, <p>Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida, is leading an effort to replicate and verify that study. He cautioned not to jump to any conclusions and that many instances in the report that appear to be double voting could in fact turn out to be administrative errors.</p>, <p>"These are all allegations at this point, none of this has been substantiated by election officials or law enforcement doing additional follow up," he said in an interview. "The allegations are one thing, but then when you actually start investigating, you find something different. We have to be clear to distinguish allegations and there hasn't been verification of the allegations in the report at this point."</p>, <p>Von Spakovsky, a member of the commission, also submitted a database from the conservative Heritage Foundation claiming to contain <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-hans-von-spakovsky-election-presentation.pdf" target="_blank">nearly 1,100</a>\xa0of instances of voter fraud. The Brennan Center for Justice released its own analysis of the report Friday, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/HeritageAnalysis_Final.pdf">debunking</a> many of the instances of alleged fraud. John Lott, a controversial gun researcher <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/rounds/trump-voter-fraud-panel-john-lott-nra/" target="_blank">whose work has been questioned</a>, submitted a presentation to the committee saying people who don\u2019t have photo ID \u2015 which several states require to vote \u2015 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-dr-john-lott-presentation.pdf">can get it if they\u2019re motivated enough</a>. But minorities, the poor and the elderly often <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/getting-a-photo-id-so-you-can-vote-is-easy-unless-youre-poor-black-latino-or-elderly/2016/05/23/8d5474ec-20f0-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html?utm_term=.4b44ccbeff3c" target="_blank">face systematic barriers</a> to getting photo identification and critics say that voter ID laws make it more difficult for them to cast a ballot.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights, which is suing the commission over its practice for disclosing documents, criticized the list of speakers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cBy stacking the deck with an all-white and male cast of panelists, the Commission has created an echo chamber to support Kris Kobach\u2019s baseless claims of voter fraud,\u201d the group\u2019s president said in a statement.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kobach caused widespread backlash <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud-panel-personal-information_us_59555bbee4b0da2c732230c2">when he sent a letter</a>\xa0to officials in all 50 states asking them to disclose sensitive voter information. But since it\u2019s first meeting on July 19, it\u2019s been unclear what the panel has been working on. Several commissioners on the probe said they\u2019re hoping to learn more about that too. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI mean that\u2019s the first thing of research, right? Know what it is you\u2019re looking for,\u201d Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap (D), a commission member, said in an interview with HuffPost. \u201cI think if we could come out with a clearer path of what it is we\u2019re trying to answer for questions, I think that would be very productive.\u201d Despite being on the commission, Dunlap has refused to turn over voter data from his state. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Dunn, a former Arkansas state lawmaker and Democratic commission member, said he hasn\u2019t had very much communication with other members of the commission and wants Kobach and other members who allege widespread voter fraud to present concrete evidence. Two other Democrats on the commission, Mark Rhodes, a the county clerk in Wood County, West Virginia, and Alan King, an Alabama probate judge, won\u2019t attend Tuesday\u2019s meeting in person because of scheduling conflicts. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King, who informed the commission he had a scheduling conflict on Sept. 12 before Tuesday, meeting was scheduled, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-submission-alan-king_statement-issues-recommendations.pdf" target="_blank">wrote a forceful statement</a> for the meeting in which he laid out 10 recommendations for the panel to consider. Those suggestions include focusing \u201cevery available American resource\u201d on allegations of Russian hacking \u2015 a topic relatively untouched by the commission \u2015 and enacting federal laws making it a crime to suppress votes. King also criticized efforts to aggressively purge voters from the rolls. Conceding there may be a few isolated instances of voter fraud, King wrote \u201cthousands upon thousands more people are stricken from voter rolls without justifiable cause or have their vote suppressed.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe reality is that the less affluent in our society are more prone to move and more prone to have an economic position in life, just to survive. But that does not mean officials in government should \u2018game the system\u2019 to deprive the less affluent from voting, simply because they may have moved from one election to another only to be stricken from the active voter list,\u201d </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-submission-alan-king_statement-issues-recommendations.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. \u201cTo move voters from active to inactive based on a flawed system is unconscionable.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kobach stirred controversy ahead of the meeting when he authored an extremely misleading <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/09/07/exclusive-kobach-out-of-state-voters-changed-outcome-new-hampshire-senate-race/" target="_blank">op-ed</a> in Breitbart, a far-right website, claiming there was proof of widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire. Kobach argued it was clear there was fraud because thousands of the people who used same-day registration using an out of state driver\u2019s license had failed to obtain a New Hampshire license by the end of August. The state, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-voter-fraud_us_59b2a699e4b0dfaafcf78300">however, sets different qualifications</a> for those who can vote and those who can obtain a driver\u2019s licenses, and election officials continue to say there\u2019s no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state. The data Kobach used to claim proof of voter fraud was submitted to the commission ahead of the Tuesday meeting.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kobach\u2019s claim prompted New Hampshire\u2019s two Democratic senators, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen, to call on New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner (D), a commissioner who helped arrange the meeting, to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-gardner-new-hampshire-voter-fraud-commission_us_59b2fea1e4b0354e4411f55d" target="_blank">step down from the panel</a>. Gardner has refused. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel has also faced at least seven lawsuits over its transparency requirements and obligations for undergoing administrative review before collecting massive amounts of voter data. While a D.C. federal judge denied several requests in those lawsuits to block the committee from meeting, the litigation is ongoing. Department of Justice lawyers recently apologized in court for failing to disclose meeting materials ahead of its meeting in July, saying the panel had gotten off to a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud_us_59a72016e4b0a8d14572d490">\u201cchaotic start.\u201d</a></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also lingering questions about how the commission plans to secure all of the voter data it plans to collect. After initially saying voter data would be stored on a military server, Kobach changed course and told state election officials it would be stored at the White House. Kobach has said the data will be deleted once the committee\u2019s work has been completed. </span></p>]

No, it is still recovering from Hurricane Harvey.\xa0</p>, <p>Should they evacuate to Rosyln, Washington, a beautiful and welcoming tourist destination in my home state? No.\xa0As I write this,\xa0Roslyn is under a Level 2 evacuation order in the face of the horrendous 26,000-acre Jolly Mountain fire.</p>, <p>Should the Irma evacuees flee to Idaho, a hotbed of climate denial?\xa0No, almost the entire state is blanketed by threats of forest fires.</p>, <p>How about being creative, and evacuating eastward, to the island paradise of Barbuda?\xa0No, it is already battered and now preparing for the next of the battering rams of an enraged atmosphere, Hurricane Jose.\xa0</p>, <p>Climate change deniers are running out of places to hide\xa0\u2015 places to hide from hurricanes, places to hide from forest fires,\xa0and places to hide from scientific truth.\xa0Yet this did not stop Donald Trump\u2019s administrator of the Environmental Protection Agenc<wbr/>y, Scott Pruitt,\xa0from taking time to proclaim:\xa0\u201cTo have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm vs.\xa0helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced.\u201d</p>, <p>Unfortunately for the Trump administration, talking about climate change is always \u201cmisplaced.\u201d\xa0But the sad and dangerous fact is that climate change is altering our climate, our weather and our future.\xa0These changes leave us precious little time in the future when climate change is not inflicting pain on someone, somewhere.</p>, <p>It is not mutually exclusive to care for and respond to those being most impacted by these disasters and at the same time hear the clarion call to take action that will keep these disasters from becoming even worse. It is why we will band together to do all we can for Texas, and why we will be there for all Floridians, even those like Rush Limbaugh who deny the clear science that climate change exposes us to increased risk of giant precipitation events, rising sea levels,\xa0and lethal forest fires.\xa0</p>, <p>The reality is that the current administration never wants to address either the science, or the public health, or the economics of climate change. They can run, but they cannot hide from Mother Nature.</p>, <p>Simply piling sandbags and nailing up plywood over the windows is not enough. Simply collecting millions in private donations and giving billions from the federal government is not enough. Simply being moved by the incredible display of neighbors helping neighbors, strangers putting their lives on the line for others and emergency responders leaving their own families to be there for the people they serve is not enough.</p>, <p>Now is precisely the time for a national commitment, when the winds are blowing and fires are burning.\xa0What we\u2019re starting to see is beyond the normal bounds of mere weather changes.\xa0</p>, <p>So what does it mean to run toward the storm and not away from it?\xa0It means that when we run for office, defeating climate change should be an absolute top priority.\xa0It means that we will call out the climate denial of our rivals, not as some peripheral and modest comment but a fundamental flaw that should disqualify candidates from public office.\xa0It means that we will build our efforts around fighting climate change, rather than appending it to our thoughts and plans.\xa0</p>, <p>That passion must become an animating force in all we do. It must extend beyond parlor room debate. We can no longer look at climate change as a second-tier issue, relegated to something confined to the environmental community. It must drive our policy and our politics in every realm and in every constituency and in every debate. In the next presidential debate it must be the defining topic, not one ignored or sidelined, and if the moderators don\u2019t ask about it, candidates must insert it aggressively, repeatedly and effectively.</p>, <p>The floods and fires are not a time just for sorrow, they must be a time for action.\xa0We must seize this moment to help the victims of these storms, and we must seize this moment to take action on climate change.</p>, <p>It is a small blue planet, but it is the only one we have.</p>]

The state\u2019s university system also employs undocumented teachers, healthcare workers and other staff. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleges that Trump\u2019s </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decision to rescind the program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> violates the Administrative Procedure Act and constitutional due process, including that of students at University of California schools and the system itself. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe administration\u2019s approach in rescinding DACA was the opposite of reasoned decision-making and thus is unlawful,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cIt did not assess the costs of rescinding DACA to the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers or to the schools and communities in which they live, study and work.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit comes on the heels of a </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-against-trump-administration-daca_us_59b0453de4b0dfaafcf4fdd7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complaint by 15 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the District of Columbia and a challenge by a former recipient of the program. All are aiming to prevent Trump from ending DACA protections. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Napolitano\u2019s lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration illegally neglected to follow rules outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, which would have required more notice and a public comment period before making such a far-reaching change. Napolitano said that the situation was distinct from the creation of DACA, which did not go through a public comment period, because the program involved case-by-case determinations about prosecutorial discretion, while Trump\u2019s decision will hit recipients en masse. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u2033[Rescinding DACA] doesn\u2019t involve discretion at all,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cIt says that for this whole category of cases the administration will not exercise discretion and will not defer deportations. So it deals with this population and a whole category, not individuals.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that DACA is also distinct from the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA, which was blocked in the courts because of a lawsuit that alleged, in part, that the Obama administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act in creating it. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday\u2019s lawsuit also argues that the Trump administration violated the due process rights of DACA recipients, which are protected by the Fifth Amendment, by \u201cexecutive fiat.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those arguments also form part of the two other legal challenges to the termination of DACA filed in New York shortly after the Trump administration announced it would phase out the signature immigration reform of the Obama years. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those cases was originally filed in Brooklyn last year by DACA recipient Mart\xedn Jonathan Batalla Vidal. He had challenged the revocation of his three-year work authorization after the program\u2019s expansion was blocked by a federal judge in Texas, along with a farther-reaching program to shield undocumented parents of U.S. citizens from deportation. Lawyers in the Batalla Vidal case requested to amend their lawsuit to challenge the termination of DACA within hours of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement on Tuesday. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition of 15 states and the District of Columbia, led by New York, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-against-trump-administration-daca_us_59b0453de4b0dfaafcf4fdd7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a second lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0on Wednesday aimed at keeping DACA alive. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of the New York lawsuits allege that Trump\u2019s decision to end DACA was motivated by an intent to discriminate against Mexicans, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-lawsuit-trump_us_59b05150e4b0354e440f053a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">citing the vitriolic statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at Mexican immigrants that he made repeatedly on the campaign trail. Napolitano\u2019s lawsuit does not include that claim. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic California Attorney General Xavier Becerra plans to file a fourth lawsuit in federal court in his home state disputing the decision to end DACA. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president has broad authority to undue the executive actions of previous administrations. But similar legal challenges largely blocked Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict virtually all visits from several Muslim-majority countries earlier this year. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not the lawsuits are ultimately successful, they open the possibility that one or more federal judges could issue an injunction that would halt the termination of DACA while the cases wind their way through the legal system. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has said he wants to work with Congress on a legislative solution for Dreamers in the six month window before many begin to lose their work permits and protections. Napolitano said she plans to continue to press members of Congress to solve the bill through law, even as she fights to maintain DACA in court. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI believe that in this case the court should act,\u201d Napolitano said, \u201cor in the alternative Congress should act and settle this matter for once and for all.\u201d</span></p>]

After that, unless they proactively cancel, they may have to pay. The <a href="https://www.trustedid.com/premier/terms-of-use.php" target="_blank">terms of use</a>\xa0say customers must have internet access and a credit or debit card to sign up.</p>, <p>\u201cWe will not bill You until the free trial period has expired and provided that You have not yet cancelled your trial membership,\u201d say the terms, dated Sept. 6. \u201cIn the event that You wish to continue Your membership beyond the trial period, do nothing and Your membership will automatically continue without interruption and We will begin billing You via the payment source You provided when you signed up for the free trial.\u201d</p>, <p>Robert Weissman, president of the consumer watchdog Public Citizen, said, \u201cIt appears that the company thinks one of the worst data breaches in history is a marketing opportunity. Instead of trying to rip people off with new hidden charges and trick consumers to give up their rights it might be a better idea to actually remedy the harm.\u201d</p>, <p>A spokesperson for Equifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the free service.</p>, <p>Customers also must agree to settle disputes outside of court in an extremely business-friendly format known as arbitration.</p>, <p>Consumer advocates describe the arbitration clause as a straightforward ripoff for the 143 million Americans whose Social Security numbers and addresses are now in the hands of criminals thanks to a breach earlier this year. Though it discovered the breach in late July, Equifax publicly\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/equifax-says-hack-potentially-exposed-details-of-143-million-consumers_us_59b1bc2de4b0354e4410b33e" target="_blank">announced</a>\xa0the news on Thursday.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cAt this point it\u2019s very clear that Equifax is trying to use this massive data breach as an excuse to profit, which is just appalling behavior,\u201d said Amanda Werner, the campaign manager at Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cI can\u2019t even put into words how awful this behavior is.\u201d</p>, <p>As Equifax explains in the terms of use, customers using its products are subject to mandatory, binding arbitration. \u201cBy consenting to submit Your Claims to arbitration, You will be forfeiting Your right to bring or participate in any class action (whether as a named plaintiff or a class member) or to share in any class action awards, including class claims where a class has not yet been certified, even if the facts and circumstances upon which the Claims are based already occurred or existed.\u201d</p>, <p>Weissman said that the arbitration clause attached to the free credit monitoring service covers only the credit monitoring service offered and not the overarching breach of data. Still, if Equifax failed to inform a customer \u2015 a victim of the hack, say \u2015 that their identity had been compromised and was being used without their knowledge, by signing up for their free credit monitoring offer and thus agreeing to the arbitration clause, they would have waived the right to sue over this failure outside of arbitration.</p>, <p>However, Equifax also requires consumers who have requested their credit score directly from the company in the past to have agreed to an arbitration clause that could cover the breach.</p>, <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve been an Equifax customer, they will claim that you have agreed to an arbitration provision,\u201d Weissman said.</p>, <p>A company spokesman said the arbitration only applied to the free credit monitoring, not the cybersecurity breach.</p>, <p>Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, are the three largest companies that track credit histories of everybody who takes out a loan or signs up a credit card, creating proprietary \u201cscores\u201d that help lenders evaluate a potential borrower\u2019s ability to pay.</p>, <p>The companies are notorious for charging access for the information, which by law is available to consumers for free once a year. Experian has been <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/05/free-credit-report-how-th_n_172190.html" target="_blank">fined multiple times</a> by the Federal Trade Commission for tricking consumers with false promises of \u201cfree\u201d credit reports that wound up costing money.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies often require consumers to use their products or services if they waive their right to pursue class action lawsuits and enter into direct arbitration with the business if they seek a legal redress to a wrong. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Equifax, everyone who signs up for the free credit monitoring the company is offering to the 143 million people whose data has been compromised is waiving their right to join in a class action suit if something goes wrong with the credit monitoring. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insertion of arbitration clauses into dense terms of service contracts that consumers rarely read has exploded in the past six years. In 2011, the Supreme Court upheld a forced arbitration provision inserted into AT&amp;T contracts in a divided 5-4 ruling. This was one of many tightly divided decisions in recent years where the conservative majority on the court </span><a href="http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaug-2014/thrown-out-of-court/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled in favor of corporate rights to force consumers into arbitration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the face of the corporate tilt of the Supreme Court, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the financial watchdog agency created by the 2010 Wall Street reform legislation, recently <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/arbitration-rule/" target="_blank">announced a new rule against mandatory arbitration clauses</a> disallowing class action lawsuits. But Republicans in Congress have vowed to strike the rule.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new CFPB arbitration rule is scheduled to take effect on Sept.\xa018. House Republicans, however, already passed a resolution in July that would block the implementation of the rule. Republicans in the Senate have introduced similar legislation, but have not yet voted on it. That legislation is not subject to a filibuster and would therefore only require 50 votes to pass in a chamber with 52 Republican senators.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, congressional Republicans are pushing legislation introduced by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) that sides with the credit reporting companies. Loudermilk\u2019s bill would place a $500,000 cap on punitive damages for consumers who have been wronged. In an ironic twist, the House Financial Services Committee </span><a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=402266" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held a hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Loudermilk\u2019s bill on Thursday \u2015 the same day Equifax revealed the breach of consumer data.</span></p>]

Max Baucus (D-Mont.), a fiscal moderate who, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presided over the passage of the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/affordable-care-act" target="_blank">Affordable Care Act</a>, expressed his support on Thursday for the creation of a single-payer health care system.</p>, <p>\u201cMy personal view is we\u2019ve got to start looking at single-payer,\u201d Baucus said in remarks at Montana State University, according to the\xa0<a href="http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/baucus-backs-single-payer-health-system/article_e481abc1-3bf0-55f2-a49e-c9786a1f11a6.html" target="_blank">Bozeman Daily Chronicle</a>. \u201cI think we should have hearings... We\u2019re getting there. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>, <p>Single-payer health care, in which the federal government insures all citizens through one large program, is a model for universal coverage in many developed countries, including Canada, France and Australia. But it has long been viewed as a pipe dream in the United States, where a <a href="http://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank">plurality of people</a> receive coverage from their employers.</p>, <p>Baucus\u2019 endorsement of the idea speaks to just how dramatically the health policy debate has shifted within the Democratic Party in recent years \u2015 particularly since the 2016 presidential run of Sen. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/bernie-sanders" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.), who made what he called \u201cMedicare for all\u201d a central issue of his campaign.</p>, <p>Baucus was the subject of <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/why-liberals-hate-max-baucus" target="_blank">progressive frustration</a> for his stewardship of the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Critics argued that he held the bill in committee far too long in hopes of winning the support of moderate Republicans who did not end up voting for the final bill. The lengthy negotiation period he initiated gave Republicans much-needed time to mobilize opposition to reform, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/04/23/max-baucus-mixed-legacy/?utm_term=.2e78cb9b88f8" target="_blank">Baucus\u2019 detractors</a>.</p>, <p>Obamacare itself relies on a hybrid model, once favored by conservative policy experts, that combines the creation of a new private, individual insurance marketplace and an expansion of Medicaid.</p>, <p>Given Baucus\u2019 history as a fiscal moderate active in the ACA\u2019s passage, his positive remarks about single-payer could provide a boost to progressive activists agitating for its implementation.</p>, <p>As Senate Finance Committee chairman, Baucus ruled out consideration of single-payer from the beginning, and declined to invite the testimony of single-payer advocates at hearings. The latter decision prompted disruptive protests from activists, and Baucus later said that\xa0<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/baucus-soothes-single-payer-backers-023293" target="_blank">he regretted</a> not engaging more with the policy\u2019s proponents.</p>, <p>In September 2009, Baucus also voted against <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/health/policy/30health.html?mcubz=3" target="_blank">two amendments</a> that would have created a public health insurance option on the Obamacare individual insurance exchanges.</p>, <p>Baucus kept single-payer off the table during the development of Obamacare because he believed the country was not ready for it at the time, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sanders-steps-push-single-payer-health-care-old-foe-switches-n799911" target="_blank">he told NBC News on Friday</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI just think the time has come,\u201d Baucus said. \u201cBack in \u201909, we were not ready to address it. It would never have passed. Here we are nine years later, I think it\u2019s time to hopefully have a very serious good faith look at it.\u201d</p>, <p>Sen. Jon Tester\xa0(D-Mont.), a moderate who represented Montana alongside Baucus from 2007 to 2014, also expressed openness to single-payer this week.</p>, <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s something we should, quite frankly, take a solid look at,\u201d <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/349493-centrist-dem-maybe-we-should-look-at-single-payer-healthcare" target="_blank">Tester said Wednesday.</a></p>, <p>Tester does not support single-payer legislation, however. When Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), aiming to put Democrats in an awkward political position, introduced a trick amendment creating a single-payer system to the Obamacare repeal bill, most Democratic senators voted \u201cpresent\u201d on the motion, but Tester was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-single-payer-amendment_us_597a19e1e4b02a4ebb73d2f6">one of four Democratic senators to vote \u201cno\u201d</a>\xa0on it.</p>, <p>Former Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) \u2015 a moderate who vehemently opposed creating a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/21/budget-buster-kent-conrad_n_264123.html">public health insurance option</a> during the passage of Obamacare \u2015 told HuffPost that unlike Baucus, he believes it is \u201cunlikely we will get a single-payer system in the foreseeable future.\u201d</p>, <p>Single-payer is improbable, Conrad argued, because funding a federal health insurance program would cost taxpayers so much and because medical providers are so opposed to radically transforming the system.\xa0</p>, <p>Instead, he said, the \u201cbest system combines universal coverage with private not-for-profit insurance with the government assisting those who cannot afford insurance.\u201d</p>, <p>He also favors empowering Medicare to negotiate bulk discounts on prescription drugs, just as the Veterans Affairs health care system does.</p>, <p>In addition to Sanders\u2019 presidential run, the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare has increased grassroots energy behind single-payer as activists seek to go on the offensive. Progressive pressure groups like <a href="https://credoaction.com/" target="_blank">Credo</a> have launched efforts to make support for the policy a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-progressives-double-push-single-payer_us_5980ebdfe4b0353fbb33406b" target="_blank">litmus test</a> for 2020\u2032s Democratic presidential candidates.</p>, <p>Single-payer now has more support in Congress than at any other time in recent history. Single-payer legislation introduced by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-conyers-single-payer-health-care-political-winner_us_5925a104e4b00c8df2a0da51" target="_blank">Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.)</a> has more co-sponsors than ever, with the support of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus.</p>, <p>Sanders plans to unveil a much-anticipated version of single-payer legislation next Wednesday. Sens. <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/baucus-soothes-single-payer-backers-023293" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> (D-Calif.), a rumored 2020 presidential contender, and <a href="https://www.elizabethwarren.com/blog/medicare-for-all" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) have already announced plans to co-sponsor the bill.</p>, <p>Polling suggests that the idea of single-payer is popular with the public, especially among Democrats. In a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx" target="_blank">May 2016 Gallup poll</a>, 58 percent of Americans and 73 percent of Democrats said they supported replacing \u201cthe ACA with a federally funded healthcare program providing insurance for all Americans.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Even elected Democrats who remain wary of single-payer have begun trying to capitalize on the ambitious proposal\u2019s popularity. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus\u2019 political action committee, Bold PAC, has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hispanic-caucus-raises-money-off-single-payer_us_59af24d9e4b0354e440d7c01?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004" target="_blank">repeatedly alluded to the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d fight</a> in fundraising e-mails \u2015 even though half of the 30 CHC members have yet to actually endorse single-payer, and the PAC does not make support for the policy a condition for its financial support.</p>, <p>Of course,\xa0it is much easier to talk about single-payer than to actually implement it. Replacing the current system with one large federal program would require a massive tax increase in exchange for what advocates believe would result in net cost reductions thanks to the government\u2019s considerable bargaining power.</p>, <p>It would also force the nearly half of Americans who get insurance from their jobs to enroll in a new government program. Given the outcry that Obamacare elicited for canceling the plans of a fraction of that number of people, enacting single-payer would likely prove an extraordinary political challenge.</p>, <p>In the meantime, though, the excitement around single-payer has already widened the spectrum of acceptable debate about health care.\xa0Expansions of coverage that once seemed radical now seem downright moderate by comparison.

This weekend, while speaking to journalists at the Toronto International Film Festival, the actor let loose with his true feelings again.</p>, <p>Speaking to\xa0<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/george-clooney-steve-bannon-review" target="_blank">Vanity Fair</a>\u2019s Krista Smith, Clooney called Bannon \u201ca schmuck who literally tried everything he could to sell scripts in Hollywood.\u201d Bannon famously wrote a screenplay for a rap musical update of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cCoriolanus,\u201d titled\xa0\u201c<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-rap-musical_us_59074c29e4b0bb2d086fc08f" target="_blank">The Thing I Am</a>.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a rap Shakespearean thing about the LA riots. It\u2019s the worst script you\u2019ve ever read,\u201d Clooney said of Bannon\u2019s creation. \u201cBut he was trying to get it made in Hollywood. And had he, he would still be in Hollywood making movies and kissing my ass to make one of his films. That\u2019s who he is.\u201d</p>, <p>Those remarks echo Clooney\u2019s comments to a separate group of journalists the previous day, according to\xa0<a href="http://ew.com/movies/2017/09/09/george-clooney-steve-bannon/" target="_blank">Entertainment Weekly</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI like picking fights. I like that Breitbart News wants to have my head. I\u2019d be ashamed 10 years from now if those weaselly little putzes, whose voices are getting a lot higher every week as this presidency starts to look worse and worse, weren\u2019t still [after me],\u201d Clooney said. \u201cSteve Bannon is a failed fucking screenwriter, and if you\u2019ve ever read [his] screenplay, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d</p>, <p>The Oscar winner similarly noted that if Bannon, who is now back as executive chairman of Breitbart, were still in Hollywood, he\u2019d be \u201clicking my ass to get me to do one of his stupid-ass screenplays.\u201d</p>, <p>Clooney has highlighted Bannon\u2019s time in Hollywood before. When criticizing Trump\u2019s response to Meryl Streep\u2019s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meryl-streep-donald-trump-golden-globes-speech_us_5872fcf4e4b043ad97e41347" target="_blank">powerful Golden Globes speech</a>\xa0in February, Clooney <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/film/george-clooney-slams-donald-trump-steve-bannon-hollywood-elitists-1986119" target="_blank">brought Bannon into the mix</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cSteve Bannon is a failed film writer and director.

The 2005 video of Trump, then a reality TV star, famously showed him bragging on a hot mike to Access Hollywood host Billy Bush that his stardom allowed him to \u201cgrab [women]\xa0by the pussy.\u201d</p>, <p>Christie failed that test, according to Bannon,\xa0when he didn\u2019t show up for a flight on the campaign jet the weekend after the scandal broke.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m Irish. I gotta get my black book and I got \u2019em,\u201d Bannon told Rose in an excerpt of the interview that aired on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d on Friday. \u201cChristie, because of Billy Bush weekend ... was not looked at for a cabinet position.\u201d</p>, <p>Bannon also lost confidence in Reince Priebus, the then-chairman of the Republican National Committee who went on to become Trump\u2019s chief of staff, over his reaction to the tape.</p>, <p>In a room full of advisers consulting Trump on how to respond to the controversial leak, Priebus told Trump he faced a choice between dropping out and losing by \u201cthe biggest landslide in American history,\u201d according to Bannon.</p>, <p>Bannon, however, insisted that Trump still had a \u201c100 percent probability of winning.\u201d</p>, <p>He bet that Trump\u2019s working-class base would not care about the tape, because it was \u201clocker room talk.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIt was a winner. That\u2019s why I told him \u2018double down\u2019 every time,\u201d Bannon recalled. \u201cAnd on that day, that\u2019s the first time and only time he ever got upset with me. He goes, \u2018Come on, it\u2019s not 100 percent.\u2019 I go, \u2018It\u2019s absolutely 100 percent.\u2019 And I told him why: \u2018They don\u2019t care.\u2019\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Bannon <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-out_us_597242dfe4b09e5f6ccf1ac8">resigned from the White House</a> under pressure in August, amid public uproar over President Trump\u2019s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-charlottesville-statement_us_59935477e4b009141640ab00">equivocal response</a> to the deadly white supremacist violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia.

His advocacy for trade and immigration restrictions, among other topics, diverged from the views of top advisers like Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council.</p>, <p>Since leaving the White House, Bannon has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-breitbart-fox-news_us_599b3157e4b06a788a2ae7ba?utm_hp_ref=steve-bannon">resumed his role</a> at the helm of Breitbart, a right-wing news site that Bannon infamously built into an outpost of pro-Trump nationalism and white racial resentment.</p>, <p>Bannon\u2019s account of Christie\u2019s estrangement from Trump is both consistent with his reputation as a validator of Trump\u2019s unapologetic instincts, and the public information available about Christie\u2019s sudden departure from Trump\u2019s orbit.</p>, <p>In the days after the Access Hollywood leak, Christie did not join other Trump campaign surrogates in defending Trump on television.</p>, <p>Instead, Christie made his first remarks on the matter while guest-hosting\xa0\u201cBoomer and Carton,\u201d a CBS New York sports talk radio show, the Tuesday after the incident. In the appearance, Christie shared his displeasure not only with Trump\u2019s conduct in the video, which he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-leaked-trump-comments-not-immaterial_us_57fce510e4b068ecb5e1a175">called \u201cindefensible,\u201d</a> but also the campaign\u2019s defense of the behavior and decision to deflect with attacks on former President Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual scandals.</p>, <p>\u201cI think he should have been much more direct and much more focused on just saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and only \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d Christie said, even as he claimed he would still supported the president\u2019s bid.</p>, <p>Christie was one of the first nationally prominent Republican officials to get behind Trump\u2019s candidacy. He endorsed the real estate mogul <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-donald-trump_us_56d0902ee4b0bf0dab31ebad">shortly after his own presidential campaign ended</a> in February 2016.\xa0</p>, <p>Trump rewarded Christie by naming him chief of the presidential transition team.

The data shows that 6,540\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">people in the state used same-day voter registration with an out-of-state drivers license. New Hampshire gives new residents 60 days to get a driver\u2019s license, but by the end of August 2017, the data showed, 5,313 of those people had not obtained a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license or register a vehicle in the state.</span></p>, <p>Kobach, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-voter-fraud-commission_us_5915e3cce4b0031e737d5d9c">who has a history of exaggerating voter fraud</a>, said the data signaled there was \u201cproof\u201d illegal votes could have swung the election in New Hampshire, noting that Hillary Clinton defeated Trump by 2,732 votes in the state and Sen. Maggie Hassan (D) defeated former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) by just over 1,000 votes.</p>, <p>His claim about voter fraud in New Hampshire comes just days before the commission is scheduled to meet there next week.</p>, <p>J.

Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result,\u201d Kobach wrote in his article.</p>, <p>But Kobach\u2019s claim of fraud is flagrantly misleading. New Hampshire sets different qualifications for people to vote and to get a driver\u2019s license. Under state law, not everyone who is qualified to vote is qualified to get a driver\u2019s license.\xa0</p>, <p>To register to vote in New Hampshire, someone only needs to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d there, meaning they currently live in the state and intend stay there for a definite period of time.</p>, <p>The definition allows people like college students, doctors completing their residency and military personnel who are stationed in the state to vote, Gilles Bissonnette, the legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire said in an email.</p>, <p>To get a driver\u2019s license, however, a person must be categorized as a \u201cresident.\u201d According to the state,\xa0people are \u201cresidents\u201d if they plan to remain in the state for an indefinite period of time.</p>, <p>The Washington Post contacted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/09/08/election-integrity-commission-members-accuse-new-hampshire-voters-of-fraud/?utm_term=.8feb3dd5ff12" target="_blank">four college students</a> in New Hampshire who had legally voted with out of state identification.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Hampshire Supreme Court </span><a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/new-hampshire/supreme-court/2015/2014-055.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spelled out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the differences between a <br/>\u201cdomicile\u201d and a \u201cresident\u201d in a 2015 decision.</span></p>, <p>\u201cUpon becoming a \u2018resident\u2019 of New Hampshire, one has 60 days in which to register one\u2019s vehicle here and to obtain a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license.

The commission has repeatedly pledged to be neutral.</p>, <p>Earlier this year, Trump said he would have won New Hampshire\u2019s electoral votes had it not been for illegal voters <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-voter-fraud_us_589e21e7e4b0ab2d2b151e51">who were bused</a> into the state to vote.

Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he author of an amendment to a spending bill that would cut funding to a respected Islamic international aid charity, was unexpectedly absent from the House floor on Thursday night, failing to offer the amendment for a vote.</span></p>, <p>The congressman told HuffPost he left Washington on Thursday ahead of the scheduled vote to prepare for Hurricane Irma, which is expected to impact his district on Florida\u2019s eastern coast in the coming days. But opponents of the amendment interpreted DeSantis\u2019 absence as a triumph of their coordinated efforts to defeat an amendment they said was motivated by Islamophobia.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/DESANT_056_xml824171640134013.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, tacked onto a consolidated appropriations bill, would have prohibited the State Department from funding for the nonprofit Islamic Relief Worldwide, a nonprofit organization that delivers emergency aid and development assistance around the world. The group\u2019s American affiliate, Islamic Relief USA (which would not have been impacted by the amendment), is currently providing assistance to Hurricane Harvey victims in Houston, Texas, and the surrounding areas.</span></p>, <p>DeSantis did not respond to a question about whether he would accept help from the group for victims of the the hurricane that is expected to hit Florida.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), one of two Muslim members of Congress, slammed the drafted amendment as a discriminatory effort to delegitimize a group that </span><a href="http://www.islamic-relief.org/about-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">describes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself as inspired by the Islamic faith. \u201cThis amendment singles out IRW for its religious affiliation. This is another attempt to criminalize and demonize organizations that are affiliated with the Muslim community,\u201d he wrote in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter that his office provided to HuffPost and circulated to all members of the House on Thursday ahead of the anticipated vote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 50 of the world\u2019s most prominent humanitarian aid groups opposed DeSantis\u2019 amendment. The list of organizations, provided by Ellison\u2019s office, included Catholic Relief Services, CARE, Oxfam, HIAS, Mercy Corps, Church World Service, Refugees International, and InterAction, a coalition of almost 200 nonprofits in the U.S.<strong>\xa0</strong></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe are humbled by the strength and diversity of support we have been given by people who really know what we are about and the values we stand for,\u201d IRW said in a statement on Friday.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis told HuffPost he remains \u201ccommitted to blocking taxpayer funds for organizations with ties to terrorist groups such as Hamas.\u201d He did not present evidence for his allegation that the charity has ties to terrorism but appears to be referencing past unfounded accusations. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, Israel and the United Arab Emirates accused IRW of ties to terrorism. The group denied the allegations and\xa0</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/11/islamic-relief-charity-palestine-work-continues-israel"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched an internal investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and hired outside consultants to review its work. The audit produced no evidence to support the allegations, the group </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30443693"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time. More recently, the Center for Security Policy, a far-right think tank headed by Frank Gaffney, </span><a href="https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2015/06/08/charity-islamic-relief-usa-strong-ties-to-terrorism-and-us-refugees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IRW of working with the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ellison, the IRW has been audited over 500 times. \u201cNone of the allegations have been demonstrated,\u201d Ellison wrote in the letter to his House colleagues.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis\u2019 amendment, Ellison said, would effectively punish the charity without first proving guilt. \u201cBecause the audits and courts could not find IRW guilty of wrongdoing, Rep. DeSantis wants us to find IRW guilty via legislative means, and punish them for it. This is a bill of attainder and is unconstitutional,\u201d Ellison wrote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If DeSantis had brought the amendment to the floor, he would have forced Republicans to take a difficult vote on a measure criticized as Islamophobic at a time when some members of the party are trying to distance themselves from President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s anti-Islam rhetoric.\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>, <p>AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who yields some control over which amendments receive a vote, referred HuffPost to the House Rules Committee when asked about Ryan\u2019s position on pulling funds from the group. Committee spokeswoman Caroline Boothe would not say whether the Rules Committee opposed the amendment.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in the United Kingdom, IRW has worked in over 30 countries, according to the group\u2019s website. The group has United Nations consultative status, takes part in the United Kingdom Disasters Emergency Committee, and works with prominent aid organizations like Catholic Relief Services, World Vision, and the Red Cross, Ellison noted in the letter. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the U.S., the IRW currently receives funding from the World Food Programme, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNICEF, UN Women, the European Community Humanitarian Office, the governments of Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The U.S. government has not placed any restrictions or designations on the group. Islamic Relief-USA is one of several organizations included in the federal government\u2019s workplace charitable giving program. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that IRW could receive such broad support if it funded or had links to terrorism,\u201d Ellison wrote. </span></p>]

In his statement, King wrote that while there may be some people who voted twice, there were thousands more who were removed from the rolls for no reason or had their vote suppressed. King won\u2019t be attending the panel\u2019s Tuesday meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, because of a scheduling conflict, he told commission organizers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe reality is that the less affluent in our society are more prone to move and more prone to have a diminished economic position in life, just to survive. But that does not mean that officials in government should \u2018game the system\u2019 to deprive the less affluent from voting, simply because they may have moved from one election to another only to be stricken from the active voter list,\u201d he wrote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King\u2019s comments are significant because they are some of the toughest comments from a sitting commission member pushing back on the suggestion that widespread voter fraud is a problem. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the commission\u2019s vice chair, <a href="http://www.kansas.com/site-services/databases/article37140699.html" target="_blank">supports a Kansas law</a> that puts people on a suspense list if they fail to show proof of citizenship when they register. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/lawyer-behind-nationwide-voter-purge-effort-named-to-trump-election-commission/" target="_blank">J. Christian Adams</a> and<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/06/30/trumps-pick-to-investigate-voter-fraud-is-freaking-out-voting-rights-activists/?utm_term=.9cd74597f193" target="_blank"> Hans von Spakovsky</a>, two other Republican commission members, also support more aggressive voter purging. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King expanded on his statement in an interview with HuffPost, saying he saw aggressive voter purging as a way of disenfranchising the poor and less affluent.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis is about protecting the affluent. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to realize that those that are affluent have a more stable type of residential situation and home life. And this is about disenfranchising, in my opinion, those perhaps who live in apartment complexes, who are maybe less educated, who maybe for whatever reason in life, they\u2019re not at a level that some people are. That\u2019s what this is about,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just me. But I do have almost 17 years of nuts and bolts experience in elections...It\u2019s clear to me that there is an agenda to deprive people of the right to vote and that is wrong.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King declined to clarify whether he was speaking specifically about Trump\u2019s commission, which critics fear will lead to widespread voter purging. That alarm was heightened when the Department of Justice sent out an unusual letter in June to\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/department-of-justice-voter-purge_us_595d22b1e4b0da2c7326c38b">44 states asking for compliance</a>\xa0with voter purge policies. The letter went out the same day Kobach sent a letter to election officials across the country requesting voter information, but the Department of Justice says the two requests are unrelated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats serving on the commission\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-gardner-new-hampshire-voter-fraud-commission_us_59b2fea1e4b0354e4411f55d">face calls to resign</a>\xa0and accusations that they are enabling an effort to weaken confidence in the American electoral system. Several have resisted those calls, saying it\u2019s better to have a seat at the table.</span></p>, <p>King said he still wants more information on what the final product of the commission\u2019s work will look like. Several commissioners have said they\u2019ve had little contact with the commission and are unsure of what Kobach has been working on since its last meeting.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWho is going to write this recommendation, when will the recommendation be written and will all members of the commission have input into the final recommendation?,\u201d King said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King added he believed he saw protecting the right to vote as crucial to America\u2019s future. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou can call it voter suppression, someone can name it whatever they want, it\u2019s about treating all people fairly and understanding the importance of the right to vote. And understanding the importance of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take away the right to vote for hundreds of thousands of people and you\u2019re destroying the will of the people. And once the will of the people is destroyed, then I truly believe this nation will fall.\u201d</span></p>]

The 80-year-old Arizona senator was found to have an aggressive form of brain tumor, glioblastoma, after surgery in July for a blood clot above his left eye.</p>, <p>\u201cAll the results so far are excellent,\u201d McCain said of his treatment, adding that the prognosis was \u201cpretty good.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m facing a challenge, but I\u2019ve faced other challenges, and I\u2019m very confident about getting through this one as well,\u201d the senator said. \u201cI\u2019ve had no side effects, no nothing except frankly an increased level of energy.\u201d</p>, <p>McCain recently completed his first round of chemotherapy and radiation, and he said that he would have an MRI on Monday, an imaging technique used to evaluate medical conditions.</p>, <p>McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, is also going to oversee work on a defense policy bill on the Senate floor next week.</p>, <p>\u201cEvery life has to end one way or another,\u201d he told CNN, adding that he was very happy with his life, including the 2008 campaign that he lost to former President Barack Obama.</p>, <p>\u201cI am able to celebrate a wonderful life and I will be grateful for additional time that I have,\u201d McCain said, adding: \u201cRemember, I\u2019m the guy who stood fifth from the bottom of his class at the Naval Academy.\u201d McCain was re-elected to a sixth Senate term in November. In the past, he has been treated for melanoma, a form of skin cancer.</p>, <p>He is the son and grandson of Navy admirals, and a U.S. Navy pilot whose plane was shot down over Vietnam in 1967. He spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam and was tortured repeatedly.</p>, <p>McCain said Sunday he hoped that people would remember him as someone who had served his country. \u201cMade a lot of mistakes, made a lot of errors, but served his country, and I hope we could add, honorably.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>\xa0</p>]

Security Council on Friday to call a meeting on Monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear program.</p>, <p>Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said it was vital to put pressure on North Korea through additional sactions, including blocking or slowing its fuel supplies.</p>, <p>\u201cIf we put firm pressure on North Korea such that it realizes it cannot develop missiles, it will accept dialog and we can progress with diplomatic efforts,\u201d Onodera told public broadcaster NHK on Sunday. \u201cUnless we firmly apply pressure, North Korea will not change its direction.\u201d</p>, <p>KCNA said Kim threw a banquet to laud the nuclear scientists and other top military and party officials who contributed to the nuclear bomb test last Sunday, topped with an art performance and a photo session with the leader himself.</p>, <p>KCNA did not specify when the banquet had been held, but analysts said it had likely been on Saturday.</p>, <p>Photos released on Sunday by KCNA showed the young leader breaking into a broad smile at the People\u2019s Theatre with two prominent scientists: Ri Hong Sop, head of North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Weapons Institute, and Hong Sung Mu, deputy director of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party of Korea\u2019s munitions industry department.</p>, <p>Ri and Hong have played vital roles in the North\u2019s nuclear program, appearing at close distance to Kim during field inspections and weapons tests, including the latest nuclear test. Ri is a former director of Yongbyon Nuclear Research Centre, North Korea\u2019s main nuclear facility north of Pyongyang, where Hong also worked as a chief engineer.</p>, <p>North Korea had said the latest test was an advanced hydrogen bomb. There was no independent confirmation but some Western experts said there was enough strong evidence to suggest the reclusive state has either developed a hydrogen bomb or was getting very close.</p>, <p>KCNA said on Sunday the scientists and technicians \u201cbrought the great auspicious event of the national history, an extra-large event through the perfect success in the test of H-bomb.\u201d</p>, <p>Kim praised the developers in his own remarks as \u201ctaking the lead\u201d in attaining the \u201cfinal goal of completing the state nuclear force\u201d in line with his parallel pursuit of nuclear and economic development.</p>, <p>\u201cThe recent test of the H-bomb is the great victory won by the Korean people at the cost of their blood while tightening their belts in the arduous period,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying.</p>, <p>Ri and Hong\u2019s roles have also been noted overseas, prompting the United Nations, the United States or South Korea to blacklist them.</p>, <p>Aside from the elite, rank-and-file North Koreans also commemorated the anniversary on Saturday by visiting the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, which houses the embalmed bodies of founding father Kim Il Sung and his son and successor Kim Jong Il.</p>, <p>KCNA said service personnel and civilians, including children, laid floral baskets and bouquets at the statues of the deceased leaders across the country, while enjoying art performances and dancing parties.

Inside, hundreds of people had gathered.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful storms to ever form in the Atlantic Ocean, is expected to make landfall somewhere in southern Florida early Sunday morning. And in the hours and days before it does, schools across the state\u2019s southernmost counties have transformed into shelters for people seeking refuge from the storm\u2019s fury.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Renaissance opened on Thursday and reached capacity by Friday evening.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYesterday we had a busy day getting everyone in, but we got everyone in safe and secure,\u201d said Mark Norville, the school\u2019s head of facility services. \u201cOrganizing, putting them into place, getting everybody into a comfortable spot. We wanted to make sure everyone who got in was comfortable, and we were able to reach that goal.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Renaissance is one of 21 schools in Broward County, which sits just north of Miami and includes coastal towns like Fort Lauderdale, that is now serving as a shelter. To the south, Miami-Dade County\xa0</span><a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/emergency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened 42 schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to shelter vulnerable residents who couldn\u2019t evacuate before the storm.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">In case you or someone you know is seeking shelter in Miami-Dade, here's the full list. 43 total, 3 pet-friendly, 6 at capacity. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Irma?src=hash">#Irma</a> <a href="https://t.co/NxG2VOwMi6">pic.twitter.com/NxG2VOwMi6</a></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everything has gone according to plan. In certain locations in Miami-Dade County on Friday, </span><a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article171988267.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confusion set in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among some local residents as certain shelters reached capacity, and others that had been announced as open weren\u2019t quite ready yet.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at New Renaissance, the process has been smooth so far, said Red Cross volunteer Pauletta Scott. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cEverybody is compliant, to say the least,\u201d Scott said as she stood outside the shelter. \u201cThey\u2019re not happy, but they are following the rules.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and local officials have ordered </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/08/us/hurricane-irma-evacuation-florida/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 6 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Florida residents \u2015 including at least 650,000 who live in Miami-Dade County \u2015 to evacuate their homes ahead of Irma, which could smash the state with winds in excess of 130 miles per hour. Storm surges could send 2- to 4-foot walls of seawater into coastal towns, and Broward County officials said they expect 10 to 20 inches of rain.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That threat has made the schools-turned shelters a vital resource for many Floridians who couldn\u2019t afford to evacuate the state or didn\u2019t get out in time, and they are a sign of how well state and local authorities have prepared for the storm, Pauletta Scott said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Red Cross volunteer, Pauletta Scott has worked through Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and Hurricane Sandy in New York. Compared to those storms, Scott said, Florida is an \u201cA1 prototype\u201d for how to prepare for a potentially catastrophic storm.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it\u2019s been a trying few days for volunteers and those seeking shelter alike. Since doors across the state opened Thursday, thousands of people seeking refuge have swarmed shelters seeking help. Broward County </span><a href="https://webapps.broward.org/newsrelease/AdminDisplayMessages.aspx?intMessageId=10690"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had served 16,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of Friday night, according to the county\u2019s emergency management division. Miami-Dade County\u2019s shelters have the capacity to accept 100,000 residents. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with those resources, shelters in more vulnerable areas have filled rapidly, leaving some residents stuck outside and searching for the next closest option. It hasn\u2019t been easy to turn people away when shelters get full, but Red Cross volunteers have tried to direct those in need to other areas that still have room.</span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWhen we turn them away, we do it lovingly, we do it with empathy,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe don\u2019t turn them away until we have to.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott\u2019s words were echoed at another shelter, where Red Cross volunteers had to turn away elderly and direct them to shelters still open.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIf I could take you in, I would take you in \u2015 swear on my heart,\u201d one volunteer said Friday afternoon at North Miami Beach High School, which had accepted 400 people in the previous 24 hours.</span>\xa0</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">At a high school in North Miami, shelter is already full. Red Cross worker tells me 400 people came in within 24 hours. <a href="https://t.co/2SUzFDFHpO">pic.twitter.com/2SUzFDFHpO</a></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though North Miami Beach High was at capacity Friday, Miami-Dade County now lists it among the 31 that are still open. New Renaissance\u2019s capacity could also fluctuate depending on the scope of the emergency, Scott suggested.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While anxiety is still present, those staying at New Renaissance Middle School Saturday said people have generally been getting along.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s my first hurricane,\u201d said Alexander Jackson, who worked for a traveling carnival circuit in Indiana before it brought him to Florida last year. \u201cHere is nice, ain\u2019t had no problems. Everybody is cool, calm, collected. Nobody fighting, no one doing any wrong, just waiting for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Vano stood outside smoking a cigarette as he watched gray clouds twist and glide forward. A native New Yorker, Vano came to Florida ten months ago for work with AT&amp;T. It\u2019s his first hurricane.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d Vano told HuffPost. \u201cI usually leave, I go west. I just didn\u2019t make it this time. Everybody left and I was basically left behind.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Vano has a house in Hollywood, Florida, he said it wasn\u2019t an option to stay in a home built \u201clike a tin can.\u201d But he said he\u2019s making do at the shelter.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI\u2019m not worried at all,\u201d Vano said of the impending storm. \u201cI come from New York, you know how it is, man. You deal with a lot out there, so this is not a big deal. This is my first time but why should I be nervous? What\u2019s gonna happen is what\u2019s gonna happen. They got mattresses.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he finished his cigarette, the darkening skies opened, dumping rain onto the shelter below. It was time to go back inside. </span></p>]

She was captured on video leaving her boyfriend\u2019s house and was reportedly on her way to pick up her children from her ex-husband, Steven McDowell. The Chambers County Sheriff\u2019s Office has said it does not believe the missing woman was a victim of the storm. Authorities suspect foul play in her disappearance, but have yet to name any suspects or persons of interest.</p>, <p>McDowell\u2019s black C-class Mercedes was found on Aug. 27, submerged in water at a Motel 6 in Mont Belvieu. Authorities said they suspected it had been parked there prior to the storm.</p>, <p>About two dozen members of the Army National Guard joined EquuSearch, making their way through thick underbrush along West Bay Road in Baytown, north of Highway 99. Searchers focused on the Cedar Bayou and surrounding areas.</p>, <p>\u201cInformation came in on the investigation that [authorities] want this area searched,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019re going where they want us to go and we\u2019re spreading out from there.\u201d</p>, <p>Volunteers spent about 12 hours searching for McDowell on Wednesday and were back at it on Thursday morning.</p>, <p>\u201cWe flew this area with two different kinds of aircraft,\u201d said Gene Robinson of\xa0<a href="http://dronepilot.io/contact/gene-robinson-bio/" target="_blank">Drone Pilot, Inc</a>. \u201cWe used high-resolution cameras, and when we came across things we had no way of identifying, we sent in ground crews with GPS coordinates.\u201d</p>, <p>Searches are ongoing this weekend.</p>, <p>Miller coordinated the search efforts just days after <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-equusearch-hurricane-harvey_us_59af3846e4b0b5e53101d6e7?3mf" target="_blank">rescuing members of his family</a> who were trapped in a Dickinson attic with rapidly rising water.</p>, <p>\u201cMy granddaughter calls and she\u2019s panicked,\u201d Miller told HuffPost of receiving a call from Natalie Weir, 28.</p>, <p>\u201cGrandpa, we\u2019re in the attic,\u201d he recalled her saying.\xa0\u201cWe called 911 and they can\u2019t even tell us when they\u2019re going to get us.

So, did she float into an isolated area that\u2019s more difficult to get to?

There, water nearly flooded over fences surrounding their reptiles,\xa0threatening their enclosure.</p>, <p>At Gatorland, where the largest gators are 14-feet long, Hileman insisted that even if one of their eight-feet-tall fences gets destroyed or blown away, \u201cthey are still not getting off of this property.\u201d</p>, <p>That\u2019s even with most of the gators preparing to ride out the storm in their outside pools. Many of the park\u2019s other residents \u2015\xa0including panthers, bobcats, goats,\xa0birds, raccoons and snakes \u2015\xa0had to be moved inside, he said.</p>, <p>Videos taken inside the park on Saturday showed<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BY05AaQhcWR/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=savannahboan" target="_blank">\xa0Gatorland employees carrying pythons\xa0</a>around their shoulders and legs as they moved the reptiles to secure facilities.

That little guy was filmed relocating alongside employee Savannah Boan.</p>, <p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go for a walk!\u201d she cheerfully called to him as he shuffled at her feet.</p>, <p>The moves came as South Florida braces for maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. As of Saturday evening, Central Florida is expected to see major flooding from rain as well as structural damage to buildings due to high winds, <a href="http://www.weather.gov/srh/tropical?office=tbw" target="_blank">according to the National Weather Service.</a></p>, <p>Hileman, however, assured that they\u2019re ready for anything.</p>, <p>In addition to the fences surrounding the property, the grounds are equipped with a water pumping system, which would allow employees to lower the water levels if it gets too high. A five-person team will also stay on the property throughout the storm, allowing them to monitor its fences should they fall or get destroyed, he said.</p>, <p>\u201cOnce the winds are around 30-35 mph, they\u2019ll go out to check perimeter fences,\u201d Hileman said.</p>, <p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gatorland/videos/10156793538558066/" target="_blank">video posted to Facebook</a> Friday evening, the park\u2019s president and CEO Mark McHugh posed with several gators along a packed shoreline where he repeated the assurance:\xa0\u201cNone of our animals are getting out.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting big hurricanes and nasty storms since 1949,\u201d he said, referencing the date the park first opened.\xa0\u201cIf you see an alligator floating down the street right by your house, it ain\u2019t ours.

But he also declines to resign from the commission.</p>, <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to step down, and it\u2019s hypocritical to ask me to step down as a member of a federal commission,\u201d <a href="http://www.wmur.com/article/gardner-refuses-call-by-congressional-delegation-to-step-down-from-trump-election-commission/12199895" target="_blank">Gardner told WMUR</a>. \u201cHave they ever stepped down from a Senate committee or a committee that they serve on because they disagreed with someone on the committee?\u201d</p>, <p>Gardner is set to host the commission\u2019s second public meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, this coming Tuesday.</p>, <p>All five Democrats serving on the commission <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/2017/05/24/commentary-dunlap-badly-mistaken-in-agreeing-to-serve-on-trump-voter-fraud-panel/" target="_blank">have faced criticism</a>.

Max Baucus (D-Mont.), a fiscal moderate who, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presided over the passage of the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/affordable-care-act" target="_blank">Affordable Care Act</a>, expressed his support on Thursday for the creation of a single-payer health care system.</p>, <p>\u201cMy personal view is we\u2019ve got to start looking at single-payer,\u201d Baucus said in remarks at Montana State University, according to the\xa0<a href="http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/baucus-backs-single-payer-health-system/article_e481abc1-3bf0-55f2-a49e-c9786a1f11a6.html" target="_blank">Bozeman Daily Chronicle</a>. \u201cI think we should have hearings... We\u2019re getting there. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>, <p>Single-payer health care, in which the federal government insures all citizens through one large program, is a model for universal coverage in many developed countries, including Canada, France and Australia. But it has long been viewed as a pipe dream in the United States, where a <a href="http://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank">plurality of people</a> receive coverage from their employers.</p>, <p>Baucus\u2019 endorsement of the idea speaks to just how dramatically the health policy debate has shifted within the Democratic Party in recent years \u2015 particularly since the 2016 presidential run of Sen. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/bernie-sanders" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.), who made what he called \u201cMedicare for all\u201d a central issue of his campaign.</p>, <p>Baucus was the subject of <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/why-liberals-hate-max-baucus" target="_blank">progressive frustration</a> for his stewardship of the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Critics argued that he held the bill in committee far too long in hopes of winning the support of moderate Republicans who did not end up voting for the final bill. The lengthy negotiation period he initiated gave Republicans much-needed time to mobilize opposition to reform, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/04/23/max-baucus-mixed-legacy/?utm_term=.2e78cb9b88f8" target="_blank">Baucus\u2019 detractors</a>.</p>, <p>Obamacare itself relies on a hybrid model, once favored by conservative policy experts, that combines the creation of a new private, individual insurance marketplace and an expansion of Medicaid.</p>, <p>Given Baucus\u2019 history as a fiscal moderate active in the ACA\u2019s passage, his positive remarks about single-payer could provide a boost to progressive activists agitating for its implementation.</p>, <p>As Senate Finance Committee chairman, Baucus ruled out consideration of single-payer from the beginning, and declined to invite the testimony of single-payer advocates at hearings. The latter decision prompted disruptive protests from activists, and Baucus later said that\xa0<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/baucus-soothes-single-payer-backers-023293" target="_blank">he regretted</a> not engaging more with the policy\u2019s proponents.</p>, <p>In September 2009, Baucus also voted against <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/health/policy/30health.html?mcubz=3" target="_blank">two amendments</a> that would have created a public health insurance option on the Obamacare individual insurance exchanges.</p>, <p>Baucus kept single-payer off the table during the development of Obamacare because he believed the country was not ready for it at the time, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sanders-steps-push-single-payer-health-care-old-foe-switches-n799911" target="_blank">he told NBC News on Friday</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI just think the time has come,\u201d Baucus said. \u201cBack in \u201909, we were not ready to address it. It would never have passed. Here we are nine years later, I think it\u2019s time to hopefully have a very serious good faith look at it.\u201d</p>, <p>Sen. Jon Tester\xa0(D-Mont.), a moderate who represented Montana alongside Baucus from 2007 to 2014, also expressed openness to single-payer this week.</p>, <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s something we should, quite frankly, take a solid look at,\u201d <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/349493-centrist-dem-maybe-we-should-look-at-single-payer-healthcare" target="_blank">Tester said Wednesday.</a></p>, <p>Tester does not support single-payer legislation, however. When Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), aiming to put Democrats in an awkward political position, introduced a trick amendment creating a single-payer system to the Obamacare repeal bill, most Democratic senators voted \u201cpresent\u201d on the motion, but Tester was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-single-payer-amendment_us_597a19e1e4b02a4ebb73d2f6">one of four Democratic senators to vote \u201cno\u201d</a>\xa0on it.</p>, <p>Former Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) \u2015 a moderate who vehemently opposed creating a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/21/budget-buster-kent-conrad_n_264123.html">public health insurance option</a> during the passage of Obamacare \u2015 told HuffPost that unlike Baucus, he believes it is \u201cunlikely we will get a single-payer system in the foreseeable future.\u201d</p>, <p>Single-payer is improbable, Conrad argued, because funding a federal health insurance program would cost taxpayers so much and because medical providers are so opposed to radically transforming the system.\xa0</p>, <p>Instead, he said, the \u201cbest system combines universal coverage with private not-for-profit insurance with the government assisting those who cannot afford insurance.\u201d</p>, <p>He also favors empowering Medicare to negotiate bulk discounts on prescription drugs, just as the Veterans Affairs health care system does.</p>, <p>In addition to Sanders\u2019 presidential run, the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare has increased grassroots energy behind single-payer as activists seek to go on the offensive. Progressive pressure groups like <a href="https://credoaction.com/" target="_blank">Credo</a> have launched efforts to make support for the policy a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-progressives-double-push-single-payer_us_5980ebdfe4b0353fbb33406b" target="_blank">litmus test</a> for 2020\u2032s Democratic presidential candidates.</p>, <p>Single-payer now has more support in Congress than at any other time in recent history. Single-payer legislation introduced by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-conyers-single-payer-health-care-political-winner_us_5925a104e4b00c8df2a0da51" target="_blank">Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.)</a> has more co-sponsors than ever, with the support of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus.</p>, <p>Sanders plans to unveil a much-anticipated version of single-payer legislation next Wednesday. Sens. <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/baucus-soothes-single-payer-backers-023293" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> (D-Calif.), a rumored 2020 presidential contender, and <a href="https://www.elizabethwarren.com/blog/medicare-for-all" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) have already announced plans to co-sponsor the bill.</p>, <p>Polling suggests that the idea of single-payer is popular with the public, especially among Democrats. In a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx" target="_blank">May 2016 Gallup poll</a>, 58 percent of Americans and 73 percent of Democrats said they supported replacing \u201cthe ACA with a federally funded healthcare program providing insurance for all Americans.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Even elected Democrats who remain wary of single-payer have begun trying to capitalize on the ambitious proposal\u2019s popularity. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus\u2019 political action committee, Bold PAC, has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hispanic-caucus-raises-money-off-single-payer_us_59af24d9e4b0354e440d7c01?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004" target="_blank">repeatedly alluded to the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d fight</a> in fundraising e-mails \u2015 even though half of the 30 CHC members have yet to actually endorse single-payer, and the PAC does not make support for the policy a condition for its financial support.</p>, <p>Of course,\xa0it is much easier to talk about single-payer than to actually implement it. Replacing the current system with one large federal program would require a massive tax increase in exchange for what advocates believe would result in net cost reductions thanks to the government\u2019s considerable bargaining power.</p>, <p>It would also force the nearly half of Americans who get insurance from their jobs to enroll in a new government program. Given the outcry that Obamacare elicited for canceling the plans of a fraction of that number of people, enacting single-payer would likely prove an extraordinary political challenge.</p>, <p>In the meantime, though, the excitement around single-payer has already widened the spectrum of acceptable debate about health care.\xa0Expansions of coverage that once seemed radical now seem downright moderate by comparison. In August, Sen. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/22/16171160/schatz-health-care-medicaid" target="_blank">Brian Schatz</a> (D-Hawaii) announced plans to introduce legislation allowing Americans of all ages and incomes to buy into Medicaid. And earlier this week, Sen. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/8/16275998/chris-murphy-single-payer" target="_blank">Chris Murphy</a> (D-Conn.) revealed his intention to introduce a bill creating a comparable universal buy-in option for Medicare, which he said\xa0\u201cmay be the fastest way to a single-payer system.\u201d</p>, <p><em>This article has been updated with comments from Tester and Conrad, as well as additional comments from Baucus.</em></p>]

Paul Ryan, Of Course!</h1>|[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON \u2015 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">President Donald Trump</a> made a bad deal for Republicans on the debt limit and government funding, and, according to House conservatives, that\u2019s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/paul-ryan">Speaker Paul Ryan</a>\u2019s fault.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What?</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A day after Trump surprised his own party by taking the first offer from congressional Democrats to raise the debt ceiling and continue government spending for three months, many House conservatives have decided that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) is ultimately to blame for Trump\u2019s impulsive deal.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cLack of preparation leads to poor choices, and the fact that we weren\u2019t here \u2015 and you heard me say this the other night \u2015 we weren\u2019t here for six weeks, the longest non-election-year break we\u2019ve had in a decade,\u201d former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Thursday, \u201cthat\u2019s a problem.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if Trump had effectively stepped in front of a bullet for Ryan by taking the blame for a bad deal that the speaker would have largely taken the responsibility for if the president had just stayed out of negotiations, Jordan said he wasn\u2019t here to blame anybody. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is we should have done what we had said back in July,\u201d Jordan answered. \u201cWe should have stayed here and put together a debt ceiling plan.\u201d</span></p>, <p>Obviously, Ryan has a lot of blame for a congressional recess, though the majority leader also has a say in the congressional schedule. But Jordan added that when lawmakers fail to prepare for deadlines, they don\u2019t have the best options come decision time.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That\u2019s not an unfair argument, but it ignores an obvious reality: This deal that Trump struck with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was a deal that Trump struck, not Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But time and again Thursday, conservatives ignored Trump\u2019s role in the agreement and found a way to blame the speaker.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think he saw the same-old, same-old kind of crap coming from leadership, and that wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) said of Trump, theorizing that the president was effectively preserving the debt limit issue until December.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as Gosar defended the president, he couldn\u2019t find an adequate reason to vote for the bill \u2015 he said he plans to oppose the package when it comes before the House \u2015 but Gosar noted he could see how this deal works to Trump\u2019s favor if the president plays his hand right.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That part seems unlikely. Lawmakers have repeatedly noted in the last two days that Trump just set a precedent that will be tough for him to break: He supported raising the debt ceiling without concessions, and he has agreed to fund the government without demanding money for his border wall.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Gosar acknowledged that Trump has made his negotiating position more difficult. \u201cHe may have lost that credibility,\u201d Gosar said. \u201cBut time will tell.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, conservatives generally refused to blame Trump for a deal that most of them believe to be bad for Republicans. Many said they couldn\u2019t answer questions until actually seeing the text of the deal. Many outright refused to answer questions. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about whether Donald Trump or Paul Ryan did a good or bad job,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And many others made tenuous connections between the deal and Paul Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI just see that the leadership team signed off on it and the rest of us find out about it,\u201d said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). King noted that Ryan and other GOP leaders didn\u2019t ever offer a conservative alternative to a clean increase in the debt ceiling \u2015 again, an argument that isn\u2019t wrong but somehow ignores the fact that Trump jumped at the chance for a clean debt limit.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) conveyed that he was disappointed in the deal. But even after he was presented with the argument that Ryan had called the Democratic offer \u201cridiculous\u201d Wednesday morning shortly before Trump took the offer, Gohmert said Ryan may actually have been a proponent of the deal. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he was or not,\u201d the congressman said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderates generally welcomed Trump\u2019s deal, noting that the president had effectively cut out the Freedom Caucus from negotiations. \u201cTo me, the main positive of this deal is we\u2019re not gonna have one group of 30 or 40 have veto power,\u201d Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow a group of 30 or 40 to be setting policy for the House of Representatives.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as much as moderates were celebrating the compromised position of conservatives, conservatives were muted in their criticism \u2015 at least of Trump, who many believe is the key to overthrowing Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservatives have quietly been laying the groundwork for a coup against Ryan, pointing out with increasing frequency that the speaker had no plan to extract GOP concessions on the debt ceiling or a continuing resolution. But it\u2019s difficult to argue that this legislation is really Ryan\u2019s fault when Trump got out in front of it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have spun Trump\u2019s decision as one recognizing that Democrats were going to win this negotiation, so better to just \u201cclear the decks\u201d and perhaps allow Congress to focus on tax reform. But even that explanation is fraught. The short-term nature of the deal ensures that lawmakers will be focused on negotiating a broader deal in December, not just cutting taxes.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan\u2019s own defense of the agreement is that Trump saw a nation recovering from one hurricane and preparing for another, and he wanted a bipartisan moment rather than a protracted disagreement. That argument may work for some, but Trump has put Republicans in a bind for future negotiations, and he did so with little to no consultation from congressional leaders or his legislative affairs staff, according to one senior GOP aide familiar with discussions.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if Trump himself wanted to preserve his conservative credentials and damage Paul Ryan, he just went ahead and did the exact opposite. The question is whether that will matter to the far-right lawmakers who already seem to be plotting Ryan\u2019s fall.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gosar was asked Thursday if he still supports Ryan as speaker, he repeatedly answered that he hadn\u2019t said \u201cone way or another.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if he would welcome Ryan campaigning for him, Gosar answered that he didn\u2019t have a challenger. Asked whether he would let Ryan even fundraise for him, Gosar said he didn\u2019t know about that, noting that Ryan was \u201cvery unpopular\u201d in his district.</span></p>]

But she said on Friday that her bigger interest \u201clies with the young people whose futures are now being put in doubt and doing all we can to support and protect those young people.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are roughly 4,000 undocumented immigrants who attend schools in the University of California system, and Napolitano said on a call with reporters that a large proportion of them have DACA protections \u2015 so-called Dreamers. The state\u2019s university system also employs undocumented teachers, healthcare workers and other staff. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleges that Trump\u2019s </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decision to rescind the program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> violates the Administrative Procedure Act and constitutional due process, including that of students at University of California schools and the system itself. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe administration\u2019s approach in rescinding DACA was the opposite of reasoned decision-making and thus is unlawful,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cIt did not assess the costs of rescinding DACA to the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers or to the schools and communities in which they live, study and work.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit comes on the heels of a </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-against-trump-administration-daca_us_59b0453de4b0dfaafcf4fdd7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complaint by 15 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the District of Columbia and a challenge by a former recipient of the program. All are aiming to prevent Trump from ending DACA protections. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Napolitano\u2019s lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration illegally neglected to follow rules outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, which would have required more notice and a public comment period before making such a far-reaching change. Napolitano said that the situation was distinct from the creation of DACA, which did not go through a public comment period, because the program involved case-by-case determinations about prosecutorial discretion, while Trump\u2019s decision will hit recipients en masse. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u2033[Rescinding DACA] doesn\u2019t involve discretion at all,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cIt says that for this whole category of cases the administration will not exercise discretion and will not defer deportations. So it deals with this population and a whole category, not individuals.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that DACA is also distinct from the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA, which was blocked in the courts because of a lawsuit that alleged, in part, that the Obama administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act in creating it. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday\u2019s lawsuit also argues that the Trump administration violated the due process rights of DACA recipients, which are protected by the Fifth Amendment, by \u201cexecutive fiat.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those arguments also form part of the two other legal challenges to the termination of DACA filed in New York shortly after the Trump administration announced it would phase out the signature immigration reform of the Obama years. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those cases was originally filed in Brooklyn last year by DACA recipient Mart\xedn Jonathan Batalla Vidal. He had challenged the revocation of his three-year work authorization after the program\u2019s expansion was blocked by a federal judge in Texas, along with a farther-reaching program to shield undocumented parents of U.S. citizens from deportation. Lawyers in the Batalla Vidal case requested to amend their lawsuit to challenge the termination of DACA within hours of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement on Tuesday. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition of 15 states and the District of Columbia, led by New York, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-against-trump-administration-daca_us_59b0453de4b0dfaafcf4fdd7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a second lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0on Wednesday aimed at keeping DACA alive. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of the New York lawsuits allege that Trump\u2019s decision to end DACA was motivated by an intent to discriminate against Mexicans, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-lawsuit-trump_us_59b05150e4b0354e440f053a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">citing the vitriolic statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at Mexican immigrants that he made repeatedly on the campaign trail. Napolitano\u2019s lawsuit does not include that claim. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic California Attorney General Xavier Becerra plans to file a fourth lawsuit in federal court in his home state disputing the decision to end DACA. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president has broad authority to undue the executive actions of previous administrations. But similar legal challenges largely blocked Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict virtually all visits from several Muslim-majority countries earlier this year. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not the lawsuits are ultimately successful, they open the possibility that one or more federal judges could issue an injunction that would halt the termination of DACA while the cases wind their way through the legal system. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has said he wants to work with Congress on a legislative solution for Dreamers in the six month window before many begin to lose their work permits and protections. Napolitano said she plans to continue to press members of Congress to solve the bill through law, even as she fights to maintain DACA in court. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI believe that in this case the court should act,\u201d Napolitano said, \u201cor in the alternative Congress should act and settle this matter for once and for all.\u201d</span></p>]

The French island of St. Martin has been 95 percent destroyed, according to local officials, and at least four people have died.\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devastation has led many to wonder what role climate change\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">may be playing in these powerful storms.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some political leaders are drawing a clear link between the two, such as Paris Mayor\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Anne_Hidalgo/status/905682345986056192" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne Hidalgo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who declared on Thursday that Irma is a \u201cconcrete manifestation\u201d of global warming. A few hours later, French President\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/TheDadGeeK/status/905757166912581635" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmanuel Macron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0said it was necessary to look at the \u201cdeep causes behind these types of events.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the connection between climate change and hurricanes is complicated, with several separate questions to consider. Is climate change causing more hurricanes (also called typhoons and cyclones, depending on where they originate)? Are the storms more powerful? Are they more destructive? And what does this portend for the future? </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see what science has to say, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">HuffPost France</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0interviewed Robert Vautard, a climatologist with France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research who specializes in the relationship between extreme events and climate change.</span></p>, <p>Researchers create mathematical models to test the ways that greenhouse gas emissions could evolve and to simulate the warming that could take place in the oceans and atmosphere. The models allow them to extrapolate how different weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, may develop in the future under varying temperature scenarios.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But so far, it\u2019s hard for the models to predict how rising temperatures will specifically affect storms. \u201cThe results lean toward a lessening in terms of the number of tropical storms and an increase in terms of wind force,\u201d Vautard said. \u201cBut there are a lot of uncertainties.\u201d</span></p>, <p>To be clear, the models are able to predict global climate scenarios with a high degree of accuracy. But predicting the evolution of storms requires even more precision, since they are only tiny events compared to the overall scale of the planet.\xa0Although there seem to be some consistencies in the storm models, their predictions can\u2019t be relied upon at this point.</p>, <p>Vautard and other scientists largely agree on one effect of climate change, however. \u201cThe impact tropical storms have is going to increase, because the atmosphere is going to warm up and will therefore contain more water,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means more rain.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more rain means more flooding, which can be just as damaging as a hurricane\u2019s strong winds, as Harvey demonstrated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another certainty is that climate change is causing sea levels to rise, which means greater storm surges and higher waves when a storm hits the coast.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cKnowing these two things, it\u2019s safe to say that hurricanes affecting low-elevation islands will therefore cause greater damage, even if they have the same features as today\u2019s do,\u201d said Vautard. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, even if scientists aren\u2019t sure about the number and potency of future tropical storms, they are fairly certain these storms will cause more damage if nothing is done to keep climate change in check. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvey caused historic flooding in Texas.

Worldwide, you could say that global warming has definitely caused an increase in rainfall, but in terms of Hurricane Harvey in particular, we\u2019ll have to wait on the studies being done right now,\u201d he said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate science is much more about examining what happens on a global multiyear average scale \u2015 not about specific events. Researchers will be studying Harvey and looking at how it fits into broader trends,\xa0Vautard said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as tropical storms are concerned,\xa0it\u2019s also difficult to know what the historic trends have been. \u201cSince they mostly happen at sea, you need satellite data to get statistics about hurricanes,\u201d said Vautard. But that type of data has only been around for about 40 years, which is not long enough to establish reliable scientific models. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, researchers will continue to improve the precision of their models, which will allow them to better understand how and why hurricanes form, and how climate factors contribute to that.\xa0\u201cWe aren\u2019t far off,\u201d Vautard said.</span></p>, <p><em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/09/06/ouragans-harvey-irma-jose-la-faute-au-rechauffement-climatique-cest-plus-complique-que-ca_a_23198411/" target="_blank">This story was first published by HuffPost France.</a></em></p>]

In his statement, King wrote that while there may be some people who voted twice, there were thousands more who were removed from the rolls for no reason or had their vote suppressed. King won\u2019t be attending the panel\u2019s Tuesday meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, because of a scheduling conflict, he told commission organizers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe reality is that the less affluent in our society are more prone to move and more prone to have a diminished economic position in life, just to survive. But that does not mean that officials in government should \u2018game the system\u2019 to deprive the less affluent from voting, simply because they may have moved from one election to another only to be stricken from the active voter list,\u201d he wrote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King\u2019s comments are significant because they are some of the toughest comments from a sitting commission member pushing back on the suggestion that widespread voter fraud is a problem. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the commission\u2019s vice chair, <a href="http://www.kansas.com/site-services/databases/article37140699.html" target="_blank">supports a Kansas law</a> that puts people on a suspense list if they fail to show proof of citizenship when they register. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/lawyer-behind-nationwide-voter-purge-effort-named-to-trump-election-commission/" target="_blank">J.

It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to realize that those that are affluent have a more stable type of residential situation and home life. And this is about disenfranchising, in my opinion, those perhaps who live in apartment complexes, who are maybe less educated, who maybe for whatever reason in life, they\u2019re not at a level that some people are. That\u2019s what this is about,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just me. But I do have almost 17 years of nuts and bolts experience in elections...It\u2019s clear to me that there is an agenda to deprive people of the right to vote and that is wrong.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King declined to clarify whether he was speaking specifically about Trump\u2019s commission, which critics fear will lead to widespread voter purging. That alarm was heightened when the Department of Justice sent out an unusual letter in June to\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/department-of-justice-voter-purge_us_595d22b1e4b0da2c7326c38b">44 states asking for compliance</a>\xa0with voter purge policies. The letter went out the same day Kobach sent a letter to election officials across the country requesting voter information, but the Department of Justice says the two requests are unrelated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats serving on the commission\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-gardner-new-hampshire-voter-fraud-commission_us_59b2fea1e4b0354e4411f55d">face calls to resign</a>\xa0and accusations that they are enabling an effort to weaken confidence in the American electoral system. Several have resisted those calls, saying it\u2019s better to have a seat at the table.</span></p>, <p>King said he still wants more information on what the final product of the commission\u2019s work will look like. Several commissioners have said they\u2019ve had little contact with the commission and are unsure of what Kobach has been working on since its last meeting.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWho is going to write this recommendation, when will the recommendation be written and will all members of the commission have input into the final recommendation?,\u201d King said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King added he believed he saw protecting the right to vote as crucial to America\u2019s future. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou can call it voter suppression, someone can name it whatever they want, it\u2019s about treating all people fairly and understanding the importance of the right to vote. And understanding the importance of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take away the right to vote for hundreds of thousands of people and you\u2019re destroying the will of the people. And once the will of the people is destroyed, then I truly believe this nation will fall.\u201d</span></p>]

The French island of St. Martin has been 95 percent destroyed, according to local officials, and at least four people have died.\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devastation has led many to wonder what role climate change\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">may be playing in these powerful storms.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some political leaders are drawing a clear link between the two, such as Paris Mayor\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Anne_Hidalgo/status/905682345986056192" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne Hidalgo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who declared on Thursday that Irma is a \u201cconcrete manifestation\u201d of global warming. A few hours later, French President\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/TheDadGeeK/status/905757166912581635" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmanuel Macron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0said it was necessary to look at the \u201cdeep causes behind these types of events.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the connection between climate change and hurricanes is complicated, with several separate questions to consider. Is climate change causing more hurricanes (also called typhoons and cyclones, depending on where they originate)? Are the storms more powerful? Are they more destructive? And what does this portend for the future? </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see what science has to say, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">HuffPost France</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0interviewed Robert Vautard, a climatologist with France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research who specializes in the relationship between extreme events and climate change.</span></p>, <p>Researchers create mathematical models to test the ways that greenhouse gas emissions could evolve and to simulate the warming that could take place in the oceans and atmosphere. The models allow them to extrapolate how different weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, may develop in the future under varying temperature scenarios.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But so far, it\u2019s hard for the models to predict how rising temperatures will specifically affect storms. \u201cThe results lean toward a lessening in terms of the number of tropical storms and an increase in terms of wind force,\u201d Vautard said. \u201cBut there are a lot of uncertainties.\u201d</span></p>, <p>To be clear, the models are able to predict global climate scenarios with a high degree of accuracy. But predicting the evolution of storms requires even more precision, since they are only tiny events compared to the overall scale of the planet.\xa0Although there seem to be some consistencies in the storm models, their predictions can\u2019t be relied upon at this point.</p>, <p>Vautard and other scientists largely agree on one effect of climate change, however. \u201cThe impact tropical storms have is going to increase, because the atmosphere is going to warm up and will therefore contain more water,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means more rain.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more rain means more flooding, which can be just as damaging as a hurricane\u2019s strong winds, as Harvey demonstrated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another certainty is that climate change is causing sea levels to rise, which means greater storm surges and higher waves when a storm hits the coast.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cKnowing these two things, it\u2019s safe to say that hurricanes affecting low-elevation islands will therefore cause greater damage, even if they have the same features as today\u2019s do,\u201d said Vautard. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, even if scientists aren\u2019t sure about the number and potency of future tropical storms, they are fairly certain these storms will cause more damage if nothing is done to keep climate change in check. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvey caused historic flooding in Texas. Is this proof that global warming is already making hurricanes worse? The United Nations\u2019\xa0</span><a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-storm-harvey-un/storm-harveys-rainfall-likely-linked-to-climate-change-u-n-idUKKCN1B919O" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Meteorological Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and some </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/8/28/16213268/harvey-climate-change">American climatologists</a>\xa0say it is, absolutely.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0But Vautard doesn\u2019t want to be that assertive. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say. Worldwide, you could say that global warming has definitely caused an increase in rainfall, but in terms of Hurricane Harvey in particular, we\u2019ll have to wait on the studies being done right now,\u201d he said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate science is much more about examining what happens on a global multiyear average scale \u2015 not about specific events. Researchers will be studying Harvey and looking at how it fits into broader trends,\xa0Vautard said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as tropical storms are concerned,\xa0it\u2019s also difficult to know what the historic trends have been. \u201cSince they mostly happen at sea, you need satellite data to get statistics about hurricanes,\u201d said Vautard. But that type of data has only been around for about 40 years, which is not long enough to establish reliable scientific models. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, researchers will continue to improve the precision of their models, which will allow them to better understand how and why hurricanes form, and how climate factors contribute to that.\xa0\u201cWe aren\u2019t far off,\u201d Vautard said.</span></p>, <p><em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/09/06/ouragans-harvey-irma-jose-la-faute-au-rechauffement-climatique-cest-plus-complique-que-ca_a_23198411/" target="_blank">This story was first published by HuffPost France.</a></em></p>]

In his statement, King wrote that while there may be some people who voted twice, there were thousands more who were removed from the rolls for no reason or had their vote suppressed. King won\u2019t be attending the panel\u2019s Tuesday meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, because of a scheduling conflict, he told commission organizers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe reality is that the less affluent in our society are more prone to move and more prone to have a diminished economic position in life, just to survive. But that does not mean that officials in government should \u2018game the system\u2019 to deprive the less affluent from voting, simply because they may have moved from one election to another only to be stricken from the active voter list,\u201d he wrote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King\u2019s comments are significant because they are some of the toughest comments from a sitting commission member pushing back on the suggestion that widespread voter fraud is a problem. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the commission\u2019s vice chair, <a href="http://www.kansas.com/site-services/databases/article37140699.html" target="_blank">supports a Kansas law</a> that puts people on a suspense list if they fail to show proof of citizenship when they register. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/lawyer-behind-nationwide-voter-purge-effort-named-to-trump-election-commission/" target="_blank">J.

It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to realize that those that are affluent have a more stable type of residential situation and home life. And this is about disenfranchising, in my opinion, those perhaps who live in apartment complexes, who are maybe less educated, who maybe for whatever reason in life, they\u2019re not at a level that some people are. That\u2019s what this is about,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just me. But I do have almost 17 years of nuts and bolts experience in elections...It\u2019s clear to me that there is an agenda to deprive people of the right to vote and that is wrong.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King declined to clarify whether he was speaking specifically about Trump\u2019s commission, which critics fear will lead to widespread voter purging. That alarm was heightened when the Department of Justice sent out an unusual letter in June to\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/department-of-justice-voter-purge_us_595d22b1e4b0da2c7326c38b">44 states asking for compliance</a>\xa0with voter purge policies. The letter went out the same day Kobach sent a letter to election officials across the country requesting voter information, but the Department of Justice says the two requests are unrelated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats serving on the commission\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-gardner-new-hampshire-voter-fraud-commission_us_59b2fea1e4b0354e4411f55d">face calls to resign</a>\xa0and accusations that they are enabling an effort to weaken confidence in the American electoral system. Several have resisted those calls, saying it\u2019s better to have a seat at the table.</span></p>, <p>King said he still wants more information on what the final product of the commission\u2019s work will look like. Several commissioners have said they\u2019ve had little contact with the commission and are unsure of what Kobach has been working on since its last meeting.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWho is going to write this recommendation, when will the recommendation be written and will all members of the commission have input into the final recommendation?,\u201d King said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King added he believed he saw protecting the right to vote as crucial to America\u2019s future. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou can call it voter suppression, someone can name it whatever they want, it\u2019s about treating all people fairly and understanding the importance of the right to vote. And understanding the importance of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take away the right to vote for hundreds of thousands of people and you\u2019re destroying the will of the people. And once the will of the people is destroyed, then I truly believe this nation will fall.\u201d</span></p>]

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) sometime next week. The groups started their campaign on Wednesday, and expect to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures.</p>, <p>The groups are mainly targeting Democrats, but they also hope some Republicans who have been critical of the president, such as Sens.

This would limit the total number of judges that can be seated in a given year.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWe want them to slow it down as much as they can,\u201d Hess told HuffPost. \u201cThey should at least be speaking out about this, making it clear what\u2019s happening so it\u2019s not just the case that this is happening under the radar.\u201d</p>, <p>For example, Credo and its allies are\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">asking Democrats to more consistently withhold so-called \u201cblue slips.\u201d The Judiciary Committee does not usually begin confirmation hearings until the senators from the home state of a federal judiciary nominee turn over blue slips of paper signaling their consent that the process proceed.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Senate Democrats are already showing greater willingness to challenge Trump\u2019s judicial nominees by withholding these pieces of paper.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Sens.

He confirmed to Yahoo News that he was questioned for more than two hours on Sept. 1 by an FBI agent and a Justice Department national security lawyer at the bureau\u2019s Washington field office.</p>, <p>Feinberg said the interview was focused on Sputnik\u2019s \u201cinternal structure, editorial processes and funding.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThey wanted to know where did my orders come from and if I ever got any direction from Moscow,\u201d Feinberg told Yahoo News. \u201cThey were interested in examples of how I was steered towards covering certain issues.\u201d</p>, <p>It is not clear whether the agent and prosecutor who questioned Feinberg were acting as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s broader investigation into Russian efforts to disrupt the 2016 election and possible links to the Trump campaign. \u201cWe are not confirming whether specific matters are or are not part of our ongoing investigation,\u201d a spokesman for Mueller emailed. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment, and the FBI did not respond to questions.</p>, <p>But the inquiry comes at a time when members of Congress and others have pushed the Justice Department to strengthen its enforcement of the FARA, especially as it relates to the operations in Washington of two Russian news organizations, Sputnik and RT (formerly known as Russia Today).</p>, <p>\u201cThis is incredibly significant,\u201d said Asha Rangappa, a former FBI counterintelligence agent and now an associate dean of Yale Law School, about the bureau\u2019s questioning of the former Sputnik reporter. \u201cThe FBI has since the 1970s taken pains not to be perceived in any way as infringing on First Amendment activity. But this tells me they have good information and intelligence that these organizations have been acting on behalf of the Kremlin and that there\u2019s a direct line between them and the [Russian influence operations] that are a significant threat to our democracy.\u201d</p>, <p>Sputnik is owned by Rossiya Segodnya, a Russian government media operation headed by Dmitri Kiselyov, a belligerent television broadcaster who is\xa0<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-media-kiselyov-propagandist/25195932.html">known as Putin\u2019s \u201cpersonal propagandist\u201d</a>\xa0and has been sanctioned by the European Union in response to Russia\u2019s intervention in Ukraine. On its website, Sputnik\xa0<a href="https://sputniknews.com/docs/about/index.html">describes itself</a>\xa0as a \u201cmodern news agency\u201d that \u201ccovers global political and economic news targeting an international audience.\u201d</p>, <p>Contacted by Yahoo News, Sputnik\u2019s U.S. editor in chief, Mindia Gavasheli, said, \u201cAny assertion that we are not a news organization is simply false.\u201d He also said he was unaware of the FBI probe. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m hearing about it, and I don\u2019t think anyone at Sputnik was contacted, so thank you for letting us know,\u201d Gavasheli said.</p>, <p>Gavasheli attributed the push to have Sputnik register through FARA to paranoia surrounding Russia. \u201cI think it tells about the atmosphere of hysteria that we are witnessing now,\u201d Gavasheli said. \u201cAnything being related to Russia right now is being considered a spycraft of some sort.\u201d</p>, <p>Both Sputnik and RT were identified in a U.S. intelligence report in January as being arms of Russia\u2019s \u201cstate-run propaganda machine\u201d that served as a \u201cplatform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.\u201d As an example, the report said, Sputnik and RT \u201cconsistently cast President-elect Trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional US media outlets that they claimed were subservient to a corrupt political establishment.\u201d</p>, <p>The investigation appears to center on whether Sputnik should be covered by the foreign agents registration law, a 1938 act passed by Congress to combat Nazi propaganda. The law mandates that foreign entities seeking to influence American public opinion and engage in lobbying must file detailed reports with the Justice Department on their funding and operations. If the Justice Department concludes that Sputnik is covered by the law, its executives in the U.S. could face criminal charges and fines, while the news agency\u2019s reports would have to be explicitly labeled as foreign propaganda rather than presented as news.</p>, <p>There is an exemption under the law for media organizations that engage in legitimate news-gathering activity. But Feinberg, the former Sputnik reporter, said the FBI agent and Justice prosecutor who interviewed him focused their questions on how Sputnik determined what stories it would cover, where its directions came from and what he knew about its sources of funding.</p>, <p>(Yahoo first learned about the FBI inquiry from a U.S. intelligence source. Feinberg then confirmed he was interviewed and showed the business cards of the FBI agent and Justice Department lawyer who questioned him.)</p>, <p>While his instructions as White House correspondent came from the senior editors and news directors at Sputnik\u2019s Washington office, Feinberg said these supervisors regularly \u201cwould say, \u2018Moscow wants this or Moscow wants that.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>The thumb drive of emails and other documents that Feinberg turned over to the FBI contains messages that could shed light on Sputnik\u2019s funding, its operations in Washington and how it makes editorial decisions. It includes documents Feinberg submitted on behalf of Sputnik to obtain congressional press credentials in which he confirmed that the Russian government is the company\u2019s main funding source.</p>, <p>The questioning of Feinberg, Sputnik\u2019s former White House correspondent,\xa0came just two weeks\xa0<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/reporter-says-state-run-russian-propaganda-outlet-pushed-cover-seth-rich-conspiracy-theory-center-new-white-house-lawsuit-000407907.html">after Yahoo News published an interview</a>\xa0in which he claimed he was fired by Sputnik\u2019s D.C. bureau chief for refusing orders to ask the president\u2019s press secretary about a since-discredited Fox News report in a televised briefing. That report claimed that WikiLeaks obtained internal Democratic National Committee emails not from material hacked by Russian intelligence services, as the U.S. government has asserted, but from a low-level DNC staffer, Seth Rich, who was murdered on the streets of Washington in July 2016. (Fox has since retracted the report.)</p>, <p>Feinberg, who first made his allegations on May 26, the day he left Sputnik, has also claimed the company pushed him to ask questions that suggested the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad, who is a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was not behind chemical attacks in that country. Feinberg said the interviewers specifically asked him about\xa0<a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/21/russian-propaganda-sputnik-reporter-215511">a piece he wrote detailing these claims</a>\xa0that was published by Politico on Aug. 21. A spokeswoman for Sputnik has previously denied Feinberg\u2019s allegations and told Yahoo News his contract with the company \u201cwas not renewed due to performance-related issues.\u201d</p>, <p>The FBI reached out to Feinberg shortly after another former Sputnik staffer, Joseph John Fionda, sent a letter to the Justice Department\u2019s national security division detailing a series of similar accusations against the news organization and requested that it be investigated for FARA violations.</p>, <p>In a brief conversation over an encrypted messaging app, Fionda told Yahoo News he also sent \u201ca big packet\u201d of information to the division on or about Aug. 15.</p>, <p>In his letter to Justice, Fionda\xa0 said he was employed by RIA Global LLC, a media company associated with Sputnik, from Sept. 5 to Oct. 19, 2015. During that time, Fionda wrote, Sputnik conducted \u201ca perception management information warfare program\u201d about Russia\u2019s military involvement in Syria. He said the news organization falsely described Russia\u2019s targets in that country as \u201cterrorists\u201d affiliated with the jihadist group ISIS when, he asserted, the Russian forces were actually bombing other anti-Assad rebel groups.</p>, <p>In another instance, Fionda said, an article he wrote in September 2015 about President Obama\u2019s repatriation of Guant\xe1namo detainees to a number of countries was \u201ccensored\u201d to omit any reference to the fact that six of the detainees were being sent back to Russia, where they were later imprisoned.</p>, <p>Fionda said his last straw with Sputnik came on Oct. 19, 2015, after excerpts of private emails from then-CIA Director John Brennan were published by a hacker on Twitter. He claimed Gavasheli, Sputnik\u2019s U.S. editor in chief, asked him to \u201cobtain the CIA Director\u2019s stolen emails\u201d from the hacker.</p>, <p>\u201cI refused because I believed this was a solicitation to espionage,\u201d Fionda wrote.</p>, <p>When he refused the order, Fionda wrote that Gavasheli told him to \u201cget the f\u2014 out of my office\u201d and then fired him.

Kennedy\u2019s action gives the full Supreme Court time to consider the merits of the Trump administration\u2019s emergency request in full. Kennedy asked refugee ban challengers to file a response by noon (1600 GMT) on Tuesday.</p>, <p>The administration did not ask the court to put on hold a separate part of the lower court ruling that exempted grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents from Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries.</p>, <p>In the court filing, the Justice Department said the 9th Circuit\u2019s decision on the refugee ban \u201cwill disrupt the status quo and frustrate orderly implementation of the order\u2019s refugee provisions.\u201d Up to 24,000 additional refugees would become eligible to enter the country than would be otherwise allowed, according to the administration.</p>, <p>The Justice Department\u2019s filing marked the latest twist in the ongoing legal fight over Trump\u2019s sweeping March 6 executive order that barred travelers from Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days, a move Trump argued was needed to prevent terrorist attacks. The same order included a 120-day ban on refugees from around the world.</p>, <p>The bans were challenged by Hawaii and other Democratic-led states, the American Civil Liberties Union and refugee groups.</p>, <p>Both provisions were blocked by lower courts but were partially revived by the Supreme Court in June, which said the bans could be applied only to people without a \u201cbona fide\u201d relationship to people or entities in the United States.</p>, <p>That prompted new litigation brought by Hawaii over the meaning of that phrase, including whether written assurances by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees would count as a bona fide relationship.</p>, <p>The Trump administration said the assurances should not, meaning such refugees would be barred.</p>, <p>The appeals court also said his administration did not persuasively explain why the broader travel ban should be enforced against close relatives of people from the six specified countries. The Justice Department said in its filing on Monday it disagreed with that part of the decision but was not seeking to block it from going into effect.</p>, <p>The broader question of whether the travel ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution, as lower courts previously ruled, will be considered by the Supreme Court in October.</p>, <p>States, civil liberties advocates and others who challenged Trump\u2019s order in court argued that it violated federal immigration law and the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. Critics called it a discriminatory \u201cMuslim ban.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s March order replaced a broader January one that was blocked by federal courts.</p>, <p>(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)</p>, <p><em>This story has been updated with the Supreme Court\u2019s response.</em></p>]

It will be guerilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy.\u201d</span></em></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thompson wrote that the United States is \u201cgoing to punish somebody for this attack, but just who or what will be blown to smithereens for it is hard to say.\u201d</span></p>, <p>He continued:</p>, <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cMaybe Afghanistan, maybe Pakistan or Iraq, or possibly all three at once.

Bush would react to the attack and how his decisions would affect the lives of everyday Americans.</p>, <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis is going to be a very expensive war, and Victory is not guaranteed \u2015 for anyone, and certainly not for anyone as baffled as George W.

If the guilty won\u2019t hold up their hands and confess, he and the Generals will ferret them out by force. Good luck.

Critics have expressed considerable alarm at the presence of certain panelists, particularly Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell (R), as well as former Justice Department officials Hans von Spakovsky and J. Christian Adams,\xa0because all four have a history of pushing more restrictive voting measures.</p>, <p>An <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-nvra_us_59698037e4b017418627ac98">email made public</a> as part of a separate ongoing lawsuit against Kobach shows he was writing a draft of an amendment to federal voting law to make it permissible for states to impose a proof of citizenship requirement to register to vote.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tuesday meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, will be divided into <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-updated-meeting-agenda-09122017.pdf" target="_blank">three panels</a>\xa0focusing on voter turnout, public confidence in elections and electronic voting systems, respectively. \xa0Some of the scheduled presentations look to paint a picture of an American election system that is ripe for voter fraud, even though <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/debunking-voter-fraud-myth" target="_blank">several studies and investigations</a> have shown it is not a widespread problem.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One presentation submitted to the commission around<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-govt-accountability-institute-problem-duplicate-voting.pdf" target="_blank">\xa08,500 likely duplicate votes </a>across 21 states. Unable to access data from all 50 states, the researchers extrapolate their findings to estimate that there are at least 45,000 instances of double voting across the country, a number still considerably short of the three to five million people Trump has alleged voted illegally last year. Those conducting the analysis compared voters\u2019 first names, last names, dates of birth and the first five digits of their social security numbers, but other studies have also shown<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/07/27/pences-voter-fraud-commission-will-almost-certainly-find-thousands-of-duplicate-registrations-that-arent-duplicates-heres-why/?utm_term=.8f2b79be2c3f" target="_blank"> it\u2019s extremely easy</a> to get false positives when comparing voter data.\xa0</span></p>, <p>Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida, is leading an effort to replicate and verify that study. He cautioned not to jump to any conclusions and that many instances in the report that appear to be double voting could in fact turn out to be administrative errors.</p>, <p>"These are all allegations at this point, none of this has been substantiated by election officials or law enforcement doing additional follow up," he said in an interview. "The allegations are one thing, but then when you actually start investigating, you find something different. We have to be clear to distinguish allegations and there hasn't been verification of the allegations in the report at this point."</p>, <p>Von Spakovsky, a member of the commission, also submitted a database from the conservative Heritage Foundation claiming to contain <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-hans-von-spakovsky-election-presentation.pdf" target="_blank">nearly 1,100</a>\xa0of instances of voter fraud. The Brennan Center for Justice released its own analysis of the report Friday, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/HeritageAnalysis_Final.pdf">debunking</a> many of the instances of alleged fraud. John Lott, a controversial gun researcher <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/rounds/trump-voter-fraud-panel-john-lott-nra/" target="_blank">whose work has been questioned</a>, submitted a presentation to the committee saying people who don\u2019t have photo ID \u2015 which several states require to vote \u2015 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-dr-john-lott-presentation.pdf">can get it if they\u2019re motivated enough</a>. But minorities, the poor and the elderly often <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/getting-a-photo-id-so-you-can-vote-is-easy-unless-youre-poor-black-latino-or-elderly/2016/05/23/8d5474ec-20f0-11e6-8690-f14ca9de2972_story.html?utm_term=.4b44ccbeff3c" target="_blank">face systematic barriers</a> to getting photo identification and critics say that voter ID laws make it more difficult for them to cast a ballot.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights, which is suing the commission over its practice for disclosing documents, criticized the list of speakers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cBy stacking the deck with an all-white and male cast of panelists, the Commission has created an echo chamber to support Kris Kobach\u2019s baseless claims of voter fraud,\u201d the group\u2019s president said in a statement.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kobach caused widespread backlash <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud-panel-personal-information_us_59555bbee4b0da2c732230c2">when he sent a letter</a>\xa0to officials in all 50 states asking them to disclose sensitive voter information. But since it\u2019s first meeting on July 19, it\u2019s been unclear what the panel has been working on. Several commissioners on the probe said they\u2019re hoping to learn more about that too. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI mean that\u2019s the first thing of research, right? Know what it is you\u2019re looking for,\u201d Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap (D), a commission member, said in an interview with HuffPost. \u201cI think if we could come out with a clearer path of what it is we\u2019re trying to answer for questions, I think that would be very productive.\u201d Despite being on the commission, Dunlap has refused to turn over voter data from his state. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Dunn, a former Arkansas state lawmaker and Democratic commission member, said he hasn\u2019t had very much communication with other members of the commission and wants Kobach and other members who allege widespread voter fraud to present concrete evidence. Two other Democrats on the commission, Mark Rhodes, a the county clerk in Wood County, West Virginia, and Alan King, an Alabama probate judge, won\u2019t attend Tuesday\u2019s meeting in person because of scheduling conflicts. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King, who informed the commission he had a scheduling conflict on Sept. 12 before Tuesday, meeting was scheduled, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-submission-alan-king_statement-issues-recommendations.pdf" target="_blank">wrote a forceful statement</a> for the meeting in which he laid out 10 recommendations for the panel to consider. Those suggestions include focusing \u201cevery available American resource\u201d on allegations of Russian hacking \u2015 a topic relatively untouched by the commission \u2015 and enacting federal laws making it a crime to suppress votes. King also criticized efforts to aggressively purge voters from the rolls. Conceding there may be a few isolated instances of voter fraud, King wrote \u201cthousands upon thousands more people are stricken from voter rolls without justifiable cause or have their vote suppressed.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe reality is that the less affluent in our society are more prone to move and more prone to have an economic position in life, just to survive. But that does not mean officials in government should \u2018game the system\u2019 to deprive the less affluent from voting, simply because they may have moved from one election to another only to be stricken from the active voter list,\u201d </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-submission-alan-king_statement-issues-recommendations.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. \u201cTo move voters from active to inactive based on a flawed system is unconscionable.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kobach stirred controversy ahead of the meeting when he authored an extremely misleading <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/09/07/exclusive-kobach-out-of-state-voters-changed-outcome-new-hampshire-senate-race/" target="_blank">op-ed</a> in Breitbart, a far-right website, claiming there was proof of widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire. Kobach argued it was clear there was fraud because thousands of the people who used same-day registration using an out of state driver\u2019s license had failed to obtain a New Hampshire license by the end of August. The state, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-voter-fraud_us_59b2a699e4b0dfaafcf78300">however, sets different qualifications</a> for those who can vote and those who can obtain a driver\u2019s licenses, and election officials continue to say there\u2019s no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the state. The data Kobach used to claim proof of voter fraud was submitted to the commission ahead of the Tuesday meeting.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kobach\u2019s claim prompted New Hampshire\u2019s two Democratic senators, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen, to call on New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner (D), a commissioner who helped arrange the meeting, to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-gardner-new-hampshire-voter-fraud-commission_us_59b2fea1e4b0354e4411f55d" target="_blank">step down from the panel</a>. Gardner has refused. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel has also faced at least seven lawsuits over its transparency requirements and obligations for undergoing administrative review before collecting massive amounts of voter data. While a D.C. federal judge denied several requests in those lawsuits to block the committee from meeting, the litigation is ongoing. Department of Justice lawyers recently apologized in court for failing to disclose meeting materials ahead of its meeting in July, saying the panel had gotten off to a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud_us_59a72016e4b0a8d14572d490">\u201cchaotic start.\u201d</a></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also lingering questions about how the commission plans to secure all of the voter data it plans to collect. After initially saying voter data would be stored on a military server, Kobach changed course and told state election officials it would be stored at the White House. Kobach has said the data will be deleted once the committee\u2019s work has been completed. </span></p>]

No, it is still recovering from Hurricane Harvey.\xa0</p>, <p>Should they evacuate to Rosyln, Washington, a beautiful and welcoming tourist destination in my home state? No.\xa0As I write this,\xa0Roslyn is under a Level 2 evacuation order in the face of the horrendous 26,000-acre Jolly Mountain fire.</p>, <p>Should the Irma evacuees flee to Idaho, a hotbed of climate denial?\xa0No, almost the entire state is blanketed by threats of forest fires.</p>, <p>How about being creative, and evacuating eastward, to the island paradise of Barbuda?\xa0No, it is already battered and now preparing for the next of the battering rams of an enraged atmosphere, Hurricane Jose.\xa0</p>, <p>Climate change deniers are running out of places to hide\xa0\u2015 places to hide from hurricanes, places to hide from forest fires,\xa0and places to hide from scientific truth.\xa0Yet this did not stop Donald Trump\u2019s administrator of the Environmental Protection Agenc<wbr/>y, Scott Pruitt,\xa0from taking time to proclaim:\xa0\u201cTo have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm vs.\xa0helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced.\u201d</p>, <p>Unfortunately for the Trump administration, talking about climate change is always \u201cmisplaced.\u201d\xa0But the sad and dangerous fact is that climate change is altering our climate, our weather and our future.\xa0These changes leave us precious little time in the future when climate change is not inflicting pain on someone, somewhere.</p>, <p>It is not mutually exclusive to care for and respond to those being most impacted by these disasters and at the same time hear the clarion call to take action that will keep these disasters from becoming even worse. It is why we will band together to do all we can for Texas, and why we will be there for all Floridians, even those like Rush Limbaugh who deny the clear science that climate change exposes us to increased risk of giant precipitation events, rising sea levels,\xa0and lethal forest fires.\xa0</p>, <p>The reality is that the current administration never wants to address either the science, or the public health, or the economics of climate change. They can run, but they cannot hide from Mother Nature.</p>, <p>Simply piling sandbags and nailing up plywood over the windows is not enough. Simply collecting millions in private donations and giving billions from the federal government is not enough. Simply being moved by the incredible display of neighbors helping neighbors, strangers putting their lives on the line for others and emergency responders leaving their own families to be there for the people they serve is not enough.</p>, <p>Now is precisely the time for a national commitment, when the winds are blowing and fires are burning.\xa0What we\u2019re starting to see is beyond the normal bounds of mere weather changes.\xa0</p>, <p>So what does it mean to run toward the storm and not away from it?\xa0It means that when we run for office, defeating climate change should be an absolute top priority.\xa0It means that we will call out the climate denial of our rivals, not as some peripheral and modest comment but a fundamental flaw that should disqualify candidates from public office.\xa0It means that we will build our efforts around fighting climate change, rather than appending it to our thoughts and plans.\xa0</p>, <p>That passion must become an animating force in all we do. It must extend beyond parlor room debate. We can no longer look at climate change as a second-tier issue, relegated to something confined to the environmental community. It must drive our policy and our politics in every realm and in every constituency and in every debate. In the next presidential debate it must be the defining topic, not one ignored or sidelined, and if the moderators don\u2019t ask about it, candidates must insert it aggressively, repeatedly and effectively.</p>, <p>The floods and fires are not a time just for sorrow, they must be a time for action.\xa0We must seize this moment to help the victims of these storms, and we must seize this moment to take action on climate change.</p>, <p>It is a small blue planet, but it is the only one we have.</p>]

But she said on Friday that her bigger interest \u201clies with the young people whose futures are now being put in doubt and doing all we can to support and protect those young people.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are roughly 4,000 undocumented immigrants who attend schools in the University of California system, and Napolitano said on a call with reporters that a large proportion of them have DACA protections \u2015 so-called Dreamers. The state\u2019s university system also employs undocumented teachers, healthcare workers and other staff. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleges that Trump\u2019s </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decision to rescind the program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> violates the Administrative Procedure Act and constitutional due process, including that of students at University of California schools and the system itself. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe administration\u2019s approach in rescinding DACA was the opposite of reasoned decision-making and thus is unlawful,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cIt did not assess the costs of rescinding DACA to the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers or to the schools and communities in which they live, study and work.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit comes on the heels of a </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-against-trump-administration-daca_us_59b0453de4b0dfaafcf4fdd7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complaint by 15 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the District of Columbia and a challenge by a former recipient of the program. All are aiming to prevent Trump from ending DACA protections. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Napolitano\u2019s lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration illegally neglected to follow rules outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, which would have required more notice and a public comment period before making such a far-reaching change. Napolitano said that the situation was distinct from the creation of DACA, which did not go through a public comment period, because the program involved case-by-case determinations about prosecutorial discretion, while Trump\u2019s decision will hit recipients en masse. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u2033[Rescinding DACA] doesn\u2019t involve discretion at all,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cIt says that for this whole category of cases the administration will not exercise discretion and will not defer deportations. So it deals with this population and a whole category, not individuals.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that DACA is also distinct from the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA, which was blocked in the courts because of a lawsuit that alleged, in part, that the Obama administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act in creating it. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday\u2019s lawsuit also argues that the Trump administration violated the due process rights of DACA recipients, which are protected by the Fifth Amendment, by \u201cexecutive fiat.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those arguments also form part of the two other legal challenges to the termination of DACA filed in New York shortly after the Trump administration announced it would phase out the signature immigration reform of the Obama years. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those cases was originally filed in Brooklyn last year by DACA recipient Mart\xedn Jonathan Batalla Vidal. He had challenged the revocation of his three-year work authorization after the program\u2019s expansion was blocked by a federal judge in Texas, along with a farther-reaching program to shield undocumented parents of U.S. citizens from deportation. Lawyers in the Batalla Vidal case requested to amend their lawsuit to challenge the termination of DACA within hours of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement on Tuesday. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition of 15 states and the District of Columbia, led by New York, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-against-trump-administration-daca_us_59b0453de4b0dfaafcf4fdd7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a second lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0on Wednesday aimed at keeping DACA alive. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of the New York lawsuits allege that Trump\u2019s decision to end DACA was motivated by an intent to discriminate against Mexicans, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-lawsuit-trump_us_59b05150e4b0354e440f053a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">citing the vitriolic statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at Mexican immigrants that he made repeatedly on the campaign trail. Napolitano\u2019s lawsuit does not include that claim. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic California Attorney General Xavier Becerra plans to file a fourth lawsuit in federal court in his home state disputing the decision to end DACA. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president has broad authority to undue the executive actions of previous administrations. But similar legal challenges largely blocked Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict virtually all visits from several Muslim-majority countries earlier this year. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not the lawsuits are ultimately successful, they open the possibility that one or more federal judges could issue an injunction that would halt the termination of DACA while the cases wind their way through the legal system. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has said he wants to work with Congress on a legislative solution for Dreamers in the six month window before many begin to lose their work permits and protections. Napolitano said she plans to continue to press members of Congress to solve the bill through law, even as she fights to maintain DACA in court. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI believe that in this case the court should act,\u201d Napolitano said, \u201cor in the alternative Congress should act and settle this matter for once and for all.\u201d</span></p>]

Still, if Equifax failed to inform a customer \u2015 a victim of the hack, say \u2015 that their identity had been compromised and was being used without their knowledge, by signing up for their free credit monitoring offer and thus agreeing to the arbitration clause, they would have waived the right to sue over this failure outside of arbitration.</p>, <p>However, Equifax also requires consumers who have requested their credit score directly from the company in the past to have agreed to an arbitration clause that could cover the breach.</p>, <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve been an Equifax customer, they will claim that you have agreed to an arbitration provision,\u201d Weissman said.</p>, <p>A company spokesman said the arbitration only applied to the free credit monitoring, not the cybersecurity breach.</p>, <p>Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, are the three largest companies that track credit histories of everybody who takes out a loan or signs up a credit card, creating proprietary \u201cscores\u201d that help lenders evaluate a potential borrower\u2019s ability to pay.</p>, <p>The companies are notorious for charging access for the information, which by law is available to consumers for free once a year. Experian has been <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/05/free-credit-report-how-th_n_172190.html" target="_blank">fined multiple times</a> by the Federal Trade Commission for tricking consumers with false promises of \u201cfree\u201d credit reports that wound up costing money.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies often require consumers to use their products or services if they waive their right to pursue class action lawsuits and enter into direct arbitration with the business if they seek a legal redress to a wrong. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Equifax, everyone who signs up for the free credit monitoring the company is offering to the 143 million people whose data has been compromised is waiving their right to join in a class action suit if something goes wrong with the credit monitoring. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insertion of arbitration clauses into dense terms of service contracts that consumers rarely read has exploded in the past six years. In 2011, the Supreme Court upheld a forced arbitration provision inserted into AT&amp;T contracts in a divided 5-4 ruling. This was one of many tightly divided decisions in recent years where the conservative majority on the court </span><a href="http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaug-2014/thrown-out-of-court/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled in favor of corporate rights to force consumers into arbitration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the face of the corporate tilt of the Supreme Court, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the financial watchdog agency created by the 2010 Wall Street reform legislation, recently <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/arbitration-rule/" target="_blank">announced a new rule against mandatory arbitration clauses</a> disallowing class action lawsuits. But Republicans in Congress have vowed to strike the rule.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new CFPB arbitration rule is scheduled to take effect on Sept.\xa018. House Republicans, however, already passed a resolution in July that would block the implementation of the rule. Republicans in the Senate have introduced similar legislation, but have not yet voted on it. That legislation is not subject to a filibuster and would therefore only require 50 votes to pass in a chamber with 52 Republican senators.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, congressional Republicans are pushing legislation introduced by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) that sides with the credit reporting companies. Loudermilk\u2019s bill would place a $500,000 cap on punitive damages for consumers who have been wronged. In an ironic twist, the House Financial Services Committee </span><a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=402266" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held a hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Loudermilk\u2019s bill on Thursday \u2015 the same day Equifax revealed the breach of consumer data.</span></p>]

Max Baucus (D-Mont.), a fiscal moderate who, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presided over the passage of the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/affordable-care-act" target="_blank">Affordable Care Act</a>, expressed his support on Thursday for the creation of a single-payer health care system.</p>, <p>\u201cMy personal view is we\u2019ve got to start looking at single-payer,\u201d Baucus said in remarks at Montana State University, according to the\xa0<a href="http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/baucus-backs-single-payer-health-system/article_e481abc1-3bf0-55f2-a49e-c9786a1f11a6.html" target="_blank">Bozeman Daily Chronicle</a>. \u201cI think we should have hearings... We\u2019re getting there. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>, <p>Single-payer health care, in which the federal government insures all citizens through one large program, is a model for universal coverage in many developed countries, including Canada, France and Australia. But it has long been viewed as a pipe dream in the United States, where a <a href="http://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank">plurality of people</a> receive coverage from their employers.</p>, <p>Baucus\u2019 endorsement of the idea speaks to just how dramatically the health policy debate has shifted within the Democratic Party in recent years \u2015 particularly since the 2016 presidential run of Sen. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/bernie-sanders" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.), who made what he called \u201cMedicare for all\u201d a central issue of his campaign.</p>, <p>Baucus was the subject of <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/why-liberals-hate-max-baucus" target="_blank">progressive frustration</a> for his stewardship of the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Critics argued that he held the bill in committee far too long in hopes of winning the support of moderate Republicans who did not end up voting for the final bill. The lengthy negotiation period he initiated gave Republicans much-needed time to mobilize opposition to reform, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/04/23/max-baucus-mixed-legacy/?utm_term=.2e78cb9b88f8" target="_blank">Baucus\u2019 detractors</a>.</p>, <p>Obamacare itself relies on a hybrid model, once favored by conservative policy experts, that combines the creation of a new private, individual insurance marketplace and an expansion of Medicaid.</p>, <p>Given Baucus\u2019 history as a fiscal moderate active in the ACA\u2019s passage, his positive remarks about single-payer could provide a boost to progressive activists agitating for its implementation.</p>, <p>As Senate Finance Committee chairman, Baucus ruled out consideration of single-payer from the beginning, and declined to invite the testimony of single-payer advocates at hearings. The latter decision prompted disruptive protests from activists, and Baucus later said that\xa0<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/baucus-soothes-single-payer-backers-023293" target="_blank">he regretted</a> not engaging more with the policy\u2019s proponents.</p>, <p>In September 2009, Baucus also voted against <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/health/policy/30health.html?mcubz=3" target="_blank">two amendments</a> that would have created a public health insurance option on the Obamacare individual insurance exchanges.</p>, <p>Baucus kept single-payer off the table during the development of Obamacare because he believed the country was not ready for it at the time, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sanders-steps-push-single-payer-health-care-old-foe-switches-n799911" target="_blank">he told NBC News on Friday</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI just think the time has come,\u201d Baucus said. \u201cBack in \u201909, we were not ready to address it. It would never have passed. Here we are nine years later, I think it\u2019s time to hopefully have a very serious good faith look at it.\u201d</p>, <p>Sen. Jon Tester\xa0(D-Mont.), a moderate who represented Montana alongside Baucus from 2007 to 2014, also expressed openness to single-payer this week.</p>, <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s something we should, quite frankly, take a solid look at,\u201d <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/349493-centrist-dem-maybe-we-should-look-at-single-payer-healthcare" target="_blank">Tester said Wednesday.</a></p>, <p>Tester does not support single-payer legislation, however. When Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), aiming to put Democrats in an awkward political position, introduced a trick amendment creating a single-payer system to the Obamacare repeal bill, most Democratic senators voted \u201cpresent\u201d on the motion, but Tester was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-single-payer-amendment_us_597a19e1e4b02a4ebb73d2f6">one of four Democratic senators to vote \u201cno\u201d</a>\xa0on it.</p>, <p>Former Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) \u2015 a moderate who vehemently opposed creating a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/21/budget-buster-kent-conrad_n_264123.html">public health insurance option</a> during the passage of Obamacare \u2015 told HuffPost that unlike Baucus, he believes it is \u201cunlikely we will get a single-payer system in the foreseeable future.\u201d</p>, <p>Single-payer is improbable, Conrad argued, because funding a federal health insurance program would cost taxpayers so much and because medical providers are so opposed to radically transforming the system.\xa0</p>, <p>Instead, he said, the \u201cbest system combines universal coverage with private not-for-profit insurance with the government assisting those who cannot afford insurance.\u201d</p>, <p>He also favors empowering Medicare to negotiate bulk discounts on prescription drugs, just as the Veterans Affairs health care system does.</p>, <p>In addition to Sanders\u2019 presidential run, the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare has increased grassroots energy behind single-payer as activists seek to go on the offensive. Progressive pressure groups like <a href="https://credoaction.com/" target="_blank">Credo</a> have launched efforts to make support for the policy a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-progressives-double-push-single-payer_us_5980ebdfe4b0353fbb33406b" target="_blank">litmus test</a> for 2020\u2032s Democratic presidential candidates.</p>, <p>Single-payer now has more support in Congress than at any other time in recent history. Single-payer legislation introduced by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-conyers-single-payer-health-care-political-winner_us_5925a104e4b00c8df2a0da51" target="_blank">Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.)</a> has more co-sponsors than ever, with the support of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus.</p>, <p>Sanders plans to unveil a much-anticipated version of single-payer legislation next Wednesday. Sens. <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/baucus-soothes-single-payer-backers-023293" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> (D-Calif.), a rumored 2020 presidential contender, and <a href="https://www.elizabethwarren.com/blog/medicare-for-all" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) have already announced plans to co-sponsor the bill.</p>, <p>Polling suggests that the idea of single-payer is popular with the public, especially among Democrats. In a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx" target="_blank">May 2016 Gallup poll</a>, 58 percent of Americans and 73 percent of Democrats said they supported replacing \u201cthe ACA with a federally funded healthcare program providing insurance for all Americans.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Even elected Democrats who remain wary of single-payer have begun trying to capitalize on the ambitious proposal\u2019s popularity. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus\u2019 political action committee, Bold PAC, has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hispanic-caucus-raises-money-off-single-payer_us_59af24d9e4b0354e440d7c01?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004" target="_blank">repeatedly alluded to the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d fight</a> in fundraising e-mails \u2015 even though half of the 30 CHC members have yet to actually endorse single-payer, and the PAC does not make support for the policy a condition for its financial support.</p>, <p>Of course,\xa0it is much easier to talk about single-payer than to actually implement it. Replacing the current system with one large federal program would require a massive tax increase in exchange for what advocates believe would result in net cost reductions thanks to the government\u2019s considerable bargaining power.</p>, <p>It would also force the nearly half of Americans who get insurance from their jobs to enroll in a new government program. Given the outcry that Obamacare elicited for canceling the plans of a fraction of that number of people, enacting single-payer would likely prove an extraordinary political challenge.</p>, <p>In the meantime, though, the excitement around single-payer has already widened the spectrum of acceptable debate about health care.\xa0Expansions of coverage that once seemed radical now seem downright moderate by comparison. In August, Sen. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/22/16171160/schatz-health-care-medicaid" target="_blank">Brian Schatz</a> (D-Hawaii) announced plans to introduce legislation allowing Americans of all ages and incomes to buy into Medicaid. And earlier this week, Sen. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/8/16275998/chris-murphy-single-payer" target="_blank">Chris Murphy</a> (D-Conn.) revealed his intention to introduce a bill creating a comparable universal buy-in option for Medicare, which he said\xa0\u201cmay be the fastest way to a single-payer system.\u201d</p>, <p><em>This article has been updated with comments from Tester and Conrad, as well as additional comments from Baucus.</em></p>]

He goes, \u2018Come on, it\u2019s not 100 percent.\u2019 I go, \u2018It\u2019s absolutely 100 percent.\u2019 And I told him why: \u2018They don\u2019t care.\u2019\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Bannon <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-out_us_597242dfe4b09e5f6ccf1ac8">resigned from the White House</a> under pressure in August, amid public uproar over President Trump\u2019s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-charlottesville-statement_us_59935477e4b009141640ab00">equivocal response</a> to the deadly white supremacist violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. Bannon <a href="https://www.axios.com/what-steve-bannon-thinks-about-charlottesville-2473751951.html?utm_medium=linkshare&amp;amp;utm_campaign=organic" target="_blank">praised Trump</a> for drawing an equivalency between the actions of white supremacist demonstrators and left-leaning counterprotesters,\xa0though it is not clear if he played a role in convincing Trump to take that approach.</p>, <p>Bannon, a self-described \u201ceconomic nationalist\u201d who fashioned himself the guardian of right-wing populism in the White House, long clashed with the so-called \u201cWall Street\u201d-wing of Trump\u2019s inner circle. His advocacy for trade and immigration restrictions, among other topics, diverged from the views of top advisers like Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner and Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council.</p>, <p>Since leaving the White House, Bannon has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-breitbart-fox-news_us_599b3157e4b06a788a2ae7ba?utm_hp_ref=steve-bannon">resumed his role</a> at the helm of Breitbart, a right-wing news site that Bannon infamously built into an outpost of pro-Trump nationalism and white racial resentment.</p>, <p>Bannon\u2019s account of Christie\u2019s estrangement from Trump is both consistent with his reputation as a validator of Trump\u2019s unapologetic instincts, and the public information available about Christie\u2019s sudden departure from Trump\u2019s orbit.</p>, <p>In the days after the Access Hollywood leak, Christie did not join other Trump campaign surrogates in defending Trump on television.</p>, <p>Instead, Christie made his first remarks on the matter while guest-hosting\xa0\u201cBoomer and Carton,\u201d a CBS New York sports talk radio show, the Tuesday after the incident. In the appearance, Christie shared his displeasure not only with Trump\u2019s conduct in the video, which he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-leaked-trump-comments-not-immaterial_us_57fce510e4b068ecb5e1a175">called \u201cindefensible,\u201d</a> but also the campaign\u2019s defense of the behavior and decision to deflect with attacks on former President Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual scandals.</p>, <p>\u201cI think he should have been much more direct and much more focused on just saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 and only \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d Christie said, even as he claimed he would still supported the president\u2019s bid.</p>, <p>Christie was one of the first nationally prominent Republican officials to get behind Trump\u2019s candidacy. He endorsed the real estate mogul <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-donald-trump_us_56d0902ee4b0bf0dab31ebad">shortly after his own presidential campaign ended</a> in February 2016.\xa0</p>, <p>Trump rewarded Christie by naming him chief of the presidential transition team. The blunt New Jersey governor was rumored to be on the short list for attorney general or another cabinet-level position in a Trump administration .</p>, <p>But shortly after Trump\u2019s successful election, he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-taps-pence-to-lead-transition-team_us_582619efe4b060adb56e3d1d">canned Christie</a> as transition chief and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-transition-shake-part-stalinesque-purge-christie-loyalists-n684081" target="_blank">purged the transition team</a> of the governor\u2019s loyalists.</p>]

The data shows that 6,540\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">people in the state used same-day voter registration with an out-of-state drivers license. New Hampshire gives new residents 60 days to get a driver\u2019s license, but by the end of August 2017, the data showed, 5,313 of those people had not obtained a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license or register a vehicle in the state.</span></p>, <p>Kobach, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-voter-fraud-commission_us_5915e3cce4b0031e737d5d9c">who has a history of exaggerating voter fraud</a>, said the data signaled there was \u201cproof\u201d illegal votes could have swung the election in New Hampshire, noting that Hillary Clinton defeated Trump by 2,732 votes in the state and Sen. Maggie Hassan (D) defeated former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) by just over 1,000 votes.</p>, <p>His claim about voter fraud in New Hampshire comes just days before the commission is scheduled to meet there next week.</p>, <p>J. Christian Adams, another member of the committee,\xa0<a href="https://pjmedia.com/jchristianadams/2017/09/07/new-data-illegal-voters-may-decided-new-hampshire-2016/" target="_blank">also seized</a> on the data as evidence of widespread voter fraud. Marc Lotter, a spokesman for Vice President Mike Pence, the commission\u2019s chair,\xa0<a href="https://twitter.com/VPPressSec/status/905874189613137924" target="_blank">also tweeted </a>a link to a story with the information.</p>, <p>\u201cIf the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result,\u201d Kobach wrote in his article.</p>, <p>But Kobach\u2019s claim of fraud is flagrantly misleading. New Hampshire sets different qualifications for people to vote and to get a driver\u2019s license. Under state law, not everyone who is qualified to vote is qualified to get a driver\u2019s license.\xa0</p>, <p>To register to vote in New Hampshire, someone only needs to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d there, meaning they currently live in the state and intend stay there for a definite period of time.</p>, <p>The definition allows people like college students, doctors completing their residency and military personnel who are stationed in the state to vote, Gilles Bissonnette, the legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire said in an email.</p>, <p>To get a driver\u2019s license, however, a person must be categorized as a \u201cresident.\u201d According to the state,\xa0people are \u201cresidents\u201d if they plan to remain in the state for an indefinite period of time.</p>, <p>The Washington Post contacted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/09/08/election-integrity-commission-members-accuse-new-hampshire-voters-of-fraud/?utm_term=.8feb3dd5ff12" target="_blank">four college students</a> in New Hampshire who had legally voted with out of state identification.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Hampshire Supreme Court </span><a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/new-hampshire/supreme-court/2015/2014-055.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spelled out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the differences between a <br/>\u201cdomicile\u201d and a \u201cresident\u201d in a 2015 decision.</span></p>, <p>\u201cUpon becoming a \u2018resident\u2019 of New Hampshire, one has 60 days in which to register one\u2019s vehicle here and to obtain a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license. These requirements do not apply to citizens who are not \u2018residents\u2019 of New Hampshire, although they have their \u2018domicile\u2019 here.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The places with the highest rates of out-of-state IDs during same day registration were college campuses, </span><a href="http://nhpr.org/post/where-were-out-state-ids-used-vote-new-hampshire-last-november#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to New Hampshire Public Radio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p>Since Trump created the commission in May, critics have long voiced alarm that it would seek to find voter fraud where it doesn\u2019t exist. Several studies have shown it <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/debunking-voter-fraud-myth" target="_blank">is not a widespread problem</a>.\xa0Kobach\u2019s Thursday op-ed provides a clear example of his attempts to distort statistics and to disregard non-permanent residents to make it seem like a pervasive problem exists. The commission has repeatedly pledged to be neutral.</p>, <p>Earlier this year, Trump said he would have won New Hampshire\u2019s electoral votes had it not been for illegal voters <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-voter-fraud_us_589e21e7e4b0ab2d2b151e51">who were bused</a> into the state to vote. New Hampshire election officials have said they have no evidence to support that claim and Trump hasn\u2019t offered any. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner (D), who is also a member of Trump\u2019s voter fraud probe, <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/data-out-state-ids-fuels-cries-fraud-2016-election#stream/0" target="_blank">told New Hampshire Public Radio</a> he still didn\u2019t have any evidence to question the outcome of the election in November. Still, earlier this year, the state passed a law <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-voter-fraud_us_59677288e4b0a0c6f1e64a89">tightening the requirements</a> for proof residents have to present when they go to register to vote</p>, <p>Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap (D), another member of the commission, said he had not yet read Kobach\u2019s op-ed, but disputed his claim.</p>, <p>\u201cI categorically disagree that not updating your driver\u2019s license is proof of voter fraud,\u201d he said in an interview.</p>, <p>Kobach recently revealed he is getting paid to write columns for Breitbart. Ethics experts have said it could run afoul of federal <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-breitbart-ethics_us_59b13f04e4b0b5e531040fe2">conflict of interest law</a> for him to write about the commission\u2019s work.<br/><br/></p>]

Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he author of an amendment to a spending bill that would cut funding to a respected Islamic international aid charity, was unexpectedly absent from the House floor on Thursday night, failing to offer the amendment for a vote.</span></p>, <p>The congressman told HuffPost he left Washington on Thursday ahead of the scheduled vote to prepare for Hurricane Irma, which is expected to impact his district on Florida\u2019s eastern coast in the coming days. But opponents of the amendment interpreted DeSantis\u2019 absence as a triumph of their coordinated efforts to defeat an amendment they said was motivated by Islamophobia.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/DESANT_056_xml824171640134013.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, tacked onto a consolidated appropriations bill, would have prohibited the State Department from funding for the nonprofit Islamic Relief Worldwide, a nonprofit organization that delivers emergency aid and development assistance around the world. The group\u2019s American affiliate, Islamic Relief USA (which would not have been impacted by the amendment), is currently providing assistance to Hurricane Harvey victims in Houston, Texas, and the surrounding areas.</span></p>, <p>DeSantis did not respond to a question about whether he would accept help from the group for victims of the the hurricane that is expected to hit Florida.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), one of two Muslim members of Congress, slammed the drafted amendment as a discriminatory effort to delegitimize a group that </span><a href="http://www.islamic-relief.org/about-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">describes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself as inspired by the Islamic faith. \u201cThis amendment singles out IRW for its religious affiliation. This is another attempt to criminalize and demonize organizations that are affiliated with the Muslim community,\u201d he wrote in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter that his office provided to HuffPost and circulated to all members of the House on Thursday ahead of the anticipated vote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 50 of the world\u2019s most prominent humanitarian aid groups opposed DeSantis\u2019 amendment. The list of organizations, provided by Ellison\u2019s office, included Catholic Relief Services, CARE, Oxfam, HIAS, Mercy Corps, Church World Service, Refugees International, and InterAction, a coalition of almost 200 nonprofits in the U.S.<strong>\xa0</strong></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe are humbled by the strength and diversity of support we have been given by people who really know what we are about and the values we stand for,\u201d IRW said in a statement on Friday.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis told HuffPost he remains \u201ccommitted to blocking taxpayer funds for organizations with ties to terrorist groups such as Hamas.\u201d He did not present evidence for his allegation that the charity has ties to terrorism but appears to be referencing past unfounded accusations. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, Israel and the United Arab Emirates accused IRW of ties to terrorism. The group denied the allegations and\xa0</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/11/islamic-relief-charity-palestine-work-continues-israel"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched an internal investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and hired outside consultants to review its work. The audit produced no evidence to support the allegations, the group </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30443693"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time. More recently, the Center for Security Policy, a far-right think tank headed by Frank Gaffney, </span><a href="https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2015/06/08/charity-islamic-relief-usa-strong-ties-to-terrorism-and-us-refugees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IRW of working with the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ellison, the IRW has been audited over 500 times. \u201cNone of the allegations have been demonstrated,\u201d Ellison wrote in the letter to his House colleagues.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis\u2019 amendment, Ellison said, would effectively punish the charity without first proving guilt. \u201cBecause the audits and courts could not find IRW guilty of wrongdoing, Rep. DeSantis wants us to find IRW guilty via legislative means, and punish them for it. This is a bill of attainder and is unconstitutional,\u201d Ellison wrote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If DeSantis had brought the amendment to the floor, he would have forced Republicans to take a difficult vote on a measure criticized as Islamophobic at a time when some members of the party are trying to distance themselves from President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s anti-Islam rhetoric.\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>, <p>AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who yields some control over which amendments receive a vote, referred HuffPost to the House Rules Committee when asked about Ryan\u2019s position on pulling funds from the group. Committee spokeswoman Caroline Boothe would not say whether the Rules Committee opposed the amendment.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in the United Kingdom, IRW has worked in over 30 countries, according to the group\u2019s website. The group has United Nations consultative status, takes part in the United Kingdom Disasters Emergency Committee, and works with prominent aid organizations like Catholic Relief Services, World Vision, and the Red Cross, Ellison noted in the letter. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the U.S., the IRW currently receives funding from the World Food Programme, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNICEF, UN Women, the European Community Humanitarian Office, the governments of Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The U.S. government has not placed any restrictions or designations on the group. Islamic Relief-USA is one of several organizations included in the federal government\u2019s workplace charitable giving program. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that IRW could receive such broad support if it funded or had links to terrorism,\u201d Ellison wrote. </span></p>]

In his statement, King wrote that while there may be some people who voted twice, there were thousands more who were removed from the rolls for no reason or had their vote suppressed. King won\u2019t be attending the panel\u2019s Tuesday meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, because of a scheduling conflict, he told commission organizers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe reality is that the less affluent in our society are more prone to move and more prone to have a diminished economic position in life, just to survive. But that does not mean that officials in government should \u2018game the system\u2019 to deprive the less affluent from voting, simply because they may have moved from one election to another only to be stricken from the active voter list,\u201d he wrote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King\u2019s comments are significant because they are some of the toughest comments from a sitting commission member pushing back on the suggestion that widespread voter fraud is a problem. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the commission\u2019s vice chair, <a href="http://www.kansas.com/site-services/databases/article37140699.html" target="_blank">supports a Kansas law</a> that puts people on a suspense list if they fail to show proof of citizenship when they register. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/lawyer-behind-nationwide-voter-purge-effort-named-to-trump-election-commission/" target="_blank">J. Christian Adams</a> and<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/06/30/trumps-pick-to-investigate-voter-fraud-is-freaking-out-voting-rights-activists/?utm_term=.9cd74597f193" target="_blank"> Hans von Spakovsky</a>, two other Republican commission members, also support more aggressive voter purging. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King expanded on his statement in an interview with HuffPost, saying he saw aggressive voter purging as a way of disenfranchising the poor and less affluent.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis is about protecting the affluent. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to realize that those that are affluent have a more stable type of residential situation and home life. And this is about disenfranchising, in my opinion, those perhaps who live in apartment complexes, who are maybe less educated, who maybe for whatever reason in life, they\u2019re not at a level that some people are. That\u2019s what this is about,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just me. But I do have almost 17 years of nuts and bolts experience in elections...It\u2019s clear to me that there is an agenda to deprive people of the right to vote and that is wrong.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King declined to clarify whether he was speaking specifically about Trump\u2019s commission, which critics fear will lead to widespread voter purging. That alarm was heightened when the Department of Justice sent out an unusual letter in June to\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/department-of-justice-voter-purge_us_595d22b1e4b0da2c7326c38b">44 states asking for compliance</a>\xa0with voter purge policies. The letter went out the same day Kobach sent a letter to election officials across the country requesting voter information, but the Department of Justice says the two requests are unrelated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats serving on the commission\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-gardner-new-hampshire-voter-fraud-commission_us_59b2fea1e4b0354e4411f55d">face calls to resign</a>\xa0and accusations that they are enabling an effort to weaken confidence in the American electoral system. Several have resisted those calls, saying it\u2019s better to have a seat at the table.</span></p>, <p>King said he still wants more information on what the final product of the commission\u2019s work will look like. Several commissioners have said they\u2019ve had little contact with the commission and are unsure of what Kobach has been working on since its last meeting.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWho is going to write this recommendation, when will the recommendation be written and will all members of the commission have input into the final recommendation?,\u201d King said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King added he believed he saw protecting the right to vote as crucial to America\u2019s future. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou can call it voter suppression, someone can name it whatever they want, it\u2019s about treating all people fairly and understanding the importance of the right to vote. And understanding the importance of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take away the right to vote for hundreds of thousands of people and you\u2019re destroying the will of the people. And once the will of the people is destroyed, then I truly believe this nation will fall.\u201d</span></p>]

Security Council on Friday to call a meeting on Monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on North Korea for its missile and nuclear program.</p>, <p>Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera said it was vital to put pressure on North Korea through additional sactions, including blocking or slowing its fuel supplies.</p>, <p>\u201cIf we put firm pressure on North Korea such that it realizes it cannot develop missiles, it will accept dialog and we can progress with diplomatic efforts,\u201d Onodera told public broadcaster NHK on Sunday. \u201cUnless we firmly apply pressure, North Korea will not change its direction.\u201d</p>, <p>KCNA said Kim threw a banquet to laud the nuclear scientists and other top military and party officials who contributed to the nuclear bomb test last Sunday, topped with an art performance and a photo session with the leader himself.</p>, <p>KCNA did not specify when the banquet had been held, but analysts said it had likely been on Saturday.</p>, <p>Photos released on Sunday by KCNA showed the young leader breaking into a broad smile at the People\u2019s Theatre with two prominent scientists: Ri Hong Sop, head of North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Weapons Institute, and Hong Sung Mu, deputy director of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party of Korea\u2019s munitions industry department.</p>, <p>Ri and Hong have played vital roles in the North\u2019s nuclear program, appearing at close distance to Kim during field inspections and weapons tests, including the latest nuclear test.

Inside, hundreds of people had gathered.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful storms to ever form in the Atlantic Ocean, is expected to make landfall somewhere in southern Florida early Sunday morning. And in the hours and days before it does, schools across the state\u2019s southernmost counties have transformed into shelters for people seeking refuge from the storm\u2019s fury.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Renaissance opened on Thursday and reached capacity by Friday evening.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYesterday we had a busy day getting everyone in, but we got everyone in safe and secure,\u201d said Mark Norville, the school\u2019s head of facility services. \u201cOrganizing, putting them into place, getting everybody into a comfortable spot. We wanted to make sure everyone who got in was comfortable, and we were able to reach that goal.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Renaissance is one of 21 schools in Broward County, which sits just north of Miami and includes coastal towns like Fort Lauderdale, that is now serving as a shelter. To the south, Miami-Dade County\xa0</span><a href="http://www.miamidade.gov/emergency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened 42 schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to shelter vulnerable residents who couldn\u2019t evacuate before the storm.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">In case you or someone you know is seeking shelter in Miami-Dade, here's the full list. 43 total, 3 pet-friendly, 6 at capacity. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Irma?src=hash">#Irma</a> <a href="https://t.co/NxG2VOwMi6">pic.twitter.com/NxG2VOwMi6</a></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everything has gone according to plan. In certain locations in Miami-Dade County on Friday, </span><a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article171988267.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confusion set in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among some local residents as certain shelters reached capacity, and others that had been announced as open weren\u2019t quite ready yet.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at New Renaissance, the process has been smooth so far, said Red Cross volunteer Pauletta Scott. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cEverybody is compliant, to say the least,\u201d Scott said as she stood outside the shelter. \u201cThey\u2019re not happy, but they are following the rules.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and local officials have ordered </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/08/us/hurricane-irma-evacuation-florida/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 6 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Florida residents \u2015 including at least 650,000 who live in Miami-Dade County \u2015 to evacuate their homes ahead of Irma, which could smash the state with winds in excess of 130 miles per hour. Storm surges could send 2- to 4-foot walls of seawater into coastal towns, and Broward County officials said they expect 10 to 20 inches of rain.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That threat has made the schools-turned shelters a vital resource for many Floridians who couldn\u2019t afford to evacuate the state or didn\u2019t get out in time, and they are a sign of how well state and local authorities have prepared for the storm, Pauletta Scott said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Red Cross volunteer, Pauletta Scott has worked through Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and Hurricane Sandy in New York. Compared to those storms, Scott said, Florida is an \u201cA1 prototype\u201d for how to prepare for a potentially catastrophic storm.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it\u2019s been a trying few days for volunteers and those seeking shelter alike. Since doors across the state opened Thursday, thousands of people seeking refuge have swarmed shelters seeking help. Broward County </span><a href="https://webapps.broward.org/newsrelease/AdminDisplayMessages.aspx?intMessageId=10690"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had served 16,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as of Friday night, according to the county\u2019s emergency management division. Miami-Dade County\u2019s shelters have the capacity to accept 100,000 residents. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with those resources, shelters in more vulnerable areas have filled rapidly, leaving some residents stuck outside and searching for the next closest option. It hasn\u2019t been easy to turn people away when shelters get full, but Red Cross volunteers have tried to direct those in need to other areas that still have room.</span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWhen we turn them away, we do it lovingly, we do it with empathy,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe don\u2019t turn them away until we have to.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott\u2019s words were echoed at another shelter, where Red Cross volunteers had to turn away elderly and direct them to shelters still open.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIf I could take you in, I would take you in \u2015 swear on my heart,\u201d one volunteer said Friday afternoon at North Miami Beach High School, which had accepted 400 people in the previous 24 hours.</span>\xa0</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">At a high school in North Miami, shelter is already full. Red Cross worker tells me 400 people came in within 24 hours. <a href="https://t.co/2SUzFDFHpO">pic.twitter.com/2SUzFDFHpO</a></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though North Miami Beach High was at capacity Friday, Miami-Dade County now lists it among the 31 that are still open. New Renaissance\u2019s capacity could also fluctuate depending on the scope of the emergency, Scott suggested.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While anxiety is still present, those staying at New Renaissance Middle School Saturday said people have generally been getting along.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s my first hurricane,\u201d said Alexander Jackson, who worked for a traveling carnival circuit in Indiana before it brought him to Florida last year. \u201cHere is nice, ain\u2019t had no problems. Everybody is cool, calm, collected. Nobody fighting, no one doing any wrong, just waiting for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Vano stood outside smoking a cigarette as he watched gray clouds twist and glide forward. A native New Yorker, Vano came to Florida ten months ago for work with AT&amp;T. It\u2019s his first hurricane.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d Vano told HuffPost. \u201cI usually leave, I go west. I just didn\u2019t make it this time. Everybody left and I was basically left behind.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Vano has a house in Hollywood, Florida, he said it wasn\u2019t an option to stay in a home built \u201clike a tin can.\u201d But he said he\u2019s making do at the shelter.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI\u2019m not worried at all,\u201d Vano said of the impending storm. \u201cI come from New York, you know how it is, man. You deal with a lot out there, so this is not a big deal. This is my first time but why should I be nervous? What\u2019s gonna happen is what\u2019s gonna happen.

It was time to go back inside. </span></p>]

Max Baucus (D-Mont.), a fiscal moderate who, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presided over the passage of the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/affordable-care-act" target="_blank">Affordable Care Act</a>, expressed his support on Thursday for the creation of a single-payer health care system.</p>, <p>\u201cMy personal view is we\u2019ve got to start looking at single-payer,\u201d Baucus said in remarks at Montana State University, according to the\xa0<a href="http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/baucus-backs-single-payer-health-system/article_e481abc1-3bf0-55f2-a49e-c9786a1f11a6.html" target="_blank">Bozeman Daily Chronicle</a>. \u201cI think we should have hearings... We\u2019re getting there. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>, <p>Single-payer health care, in which the federal government insures all citizens through one large program, is a model for universal coverage in many developed countries, including Canada, France and Australia. But it has long been viewed as a pipe dream in the United States, where a <a href="http://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank">plurality of people</a> receive coverage from their employers.</p>, <p>Baucus\u2019 endorsement of the idea speaks to just how dramatically the health policy debate has shifted within the Democratic Party in recent years \u2015 particularly since the 2016 presidential run of Sen. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/bernie-sanders" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.), who made what he called \u201cMedicare for all\u201d a central issue of his campaign.</p>, <p>Baucus was the subject of <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/why-liberals-hate-max-baucus" target="_blank">progressive frustration</a> for his stewardship of the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Critics argued that he held the bill in committee far too long in hopes of winning the support of moderate Republicans who did not end up voting for the final bill. The lengthy negotiation period he initiated gave Republicans much-needed time to mobilize opposition to reform, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/04/23/max-baucus-mixed-legacy/?utm_term=.2e78cb9b88f8" target="_blank">Baucus\u2019 detractors</a>.</p>, <p>Obamacare itself relies on a hybrid model, once favored by conservative policy experts, that combines the creation of a new private, individual insurance marketplace and an expansion of Medicaid.</p>, <p>Given Baucus\u2019 history as a fiscal moderate active in the ACA\u2019s passage, his positive remarks about single-payer could provide a boost to progressive activists agitating for its implementation.</p>, <p>As Senate Finance Committee chairman, Baucus ruled out consideration of single-payer from the beginning, and declined to invite the testimony of single-payer advocates at hearings. The latter decision prompted disruptive protests from activists, and Baucus later said that\xa0<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/baucus-soothes-single-payer-backers-023293" target="_blank">he regretted</a> not engaging more with the policy\u2019s proponents.</p>, <p>In September 2009, Baucus also voted against <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/health/policy/30health.html?mcubz=3" target="_blank">two amendments</a> that would have created a public health insurance option on the Obamacare individual insurance exchanges.</p>, <p>Baucus kept single-payer off the table during the development of Obamacare because he believed the country was not ready for it at the time, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sanders-steps-push-single-payer-health-care-old-foe-switches-n799911" target="_blank">he told NBC News on Friday</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI just think the time has come,\u201d Baucus said. \u201cBack in \u201909, we were not ready to address it. It would never have passed. Here we are nine years later, I think it\u2019s time to hopefully have a very serious good faith look at it.\u201d</p>, <p>Sen. Jon Tester\xa0(D-Mont.), a moderate who represented Montana alongside Baucus from 2007 to 2014, also expressed openness to single-payer this week.</p>, <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s something we should, quite frankly, take a solid look at,\u201d <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/349493-centrist-dem-maybe-we-should-look-at-single-payer-healthcare" target="_blank">Tester said Wednesday.</a></p>, <p>Tester does not support single-payer legislation, however. When Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), aiming to put Democrats in an awkward political position, introduced a trick amendment creating a single-payer system to the Obamacare repeal bill, most Democratic senators voted \u201cpresent\u201d on the motion, but Tester was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-single-payer-amendment_us_597a19e1e4b02a4ebb73d2f6">one of four Democratic senators to vote \u201cno\u201d</a>\xa0on it.</p>, <p>Former Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) \u2015 a moderate who vehemently opposed creating a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/21/budget-buster-kent-conrad_n_264123.html">public health insurance option</a> during the passage of Obamacare \u2015 told HuffPost that unlike Baucus, he believes it is \u201cunlikely we will get a single-payer system in the foreseeable future.\u201d</p>, <p>Single-payer is improbable, Conrad argued, because funding a federal health insurance program would cost taxpayers so much and because medical providers are so opposed to radically transforming the system.\xa0</p>, <p>Instead, he said, the \u201cbest system combines universal coverage with private not-for-profit insurance with the government assisting those who cannot afford insurance.\u201d</p>, <p>He also favors empowering Medicare to negotiate bulk discounts on prescription drugs, just as the Veterans Affairs health care system does.</p>, <p>In addition to Sanders\u2019 presidential run, the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare has increased grassroots energy behind single-payer as activists seek to go on the offensive. Progressive pressure groups like <a href="https://credoaction.com/" target="_blank">Credo</a> have launched efforts to make support for the policy a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-progressives-double-push-single-payer_us_5980ebdfe4b0353fbb33406b" target="_blank">litmus test</a> for 2020\u2032s Democratic presidential candidates.</p>, <p>Single-payer now has more support in Congress than at any other time in recent history. Single-payer legislation introduced by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-conyers-single-payer-health-care-political-winner_us_5925a104e4b00c8df2a0da51" target="_blank">Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.)</a> has more co-sponsors than ever, with the support of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus.</p>, <p>Sanders plans to unveil a much-anticipated version of single-payer legislation next Wednesday. Sens. <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/baucus-soothes-single-payer-backers-023293" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> (D-Calif.), a rumored 2020 presidential contender, and <a href="https://www.elizabethwarren.com/blog/medicare-for-all" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) have already announced plans to co-sponsor the bill.</p>, <p>Polling suggests that the idea of single-payer is popular with the public, especially among Democrats. In a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx" target="_blank">May 2016 Gallup poll</a>, 58 percent of Americans and 73 percent of Democrats said they supported replacing \u201cthe ACA with a federally funded healthcare program providing insurance for all Americans.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Even elected Democrats who remain wary of single-payer have begun trying to capitalize on the ambitious proposal\u2019s popularity. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus\u2019 political action committee, Bold PAC, has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hispanic-caucus-raises-money-off-single-payer_us_59af24d9e4b0354e440d7c01?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004" target="_blank">repeatedly alluded to the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d fight</a> in fundraising e-mails \u2015 even though half of the 30 CHC members have yet to actually endorse single-payer, and the PAC does not make support for the policy a condition for its financial support.</p>, <p>Of course,\xa0it is much easier to talk about single-payer than to actually implement it. Replacing the current system with one large federal program would require a massive tax increase in exchange for what advocates believe would result in net cost reductions thanks to the government\u2019s considerable bargaining power.</p>, <p>It would also force the nearly half of Americans who get insurance from their jobs to enroll in a new government program. Given the outcry that Obamacare elicited for canceling the plans of a fraction of that number of people, enacting single-payer would likely prove an extraordinary political challenge.</p>, <p>In the meantime, though, the excitement around single-payer has already widened the spectrum of acceptable debate about health care.\xa0Expansions of coverage that once seemed radical now seem downright moderate by comparison. In August, Sen. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/22/16171160/schatz-health-care-medicaid" target="_blank">Brian Schatz</a> (D-Hawaii) announced plans to introduce legislation allowing Americans of all ages and incomes to buy into Medicaid.

Paul Ryan, Of Course!</h1>|[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON \u2015 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">President Donald Trump</a> made a bad deal for Republicans on the debt limit and government funding, and, according to House conservatives, that\u2019s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/paul-ryan">Speaker Paul Ryan</a>\u2019s fault.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What?</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A day after Trump surprised his own party by taking the first offer from congressional Democrats to raise the debt ceiling and continue government spending for three months, many House conservatives have decided that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) is ultimately to blame for Trump\u2019s impulsive deal.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cLack of preparation leads to poor choices, and the fact that we weren\u2019t here \u2015 and you heard me say this the other night \u2015 we weren\u2019t here for six weeks, the longest non-election-year break we\u2019ve had in a decade,\u201d former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Thursday, \u201cthat\u2019s a problem.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if Trump had effectively stepped in front of a bullet for Ryan by taking the blame for a bad deal that the speaker would have largely taken the responsibility for if the president had just stayed out of negotiations, Jordan said he wasn\u2019t here to blame anybody. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is we should have done what we had said back in July,\u201d Jordan answered. \u201cWe should have stayed here and put together a debt ceiling plan.\u201d</span></p>, <p>Obviously, Ryan has a lot of blame for a congressional recess, though the majority leader also has a say in the congressional schedule. But Jordan added that when lawmakers fail to prepare for deadlines, they don\u2019t have the best options come decision time.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That\u2019s not an unfair argument, but it ignores an obvious reality: This deal that Trump struck with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was a deal that Trump struck, not Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But time and again Thursday, conservatives ignored Trump\u2019s role in the agreement and found a way to blame the speaker.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think he saw the same-old, same-old kind of crap coming from leadership, and that wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) said of Trump, theorizing that the president was effectively preserving the debt limit issue until December.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as Gosar defended the president, he couldn\u2019t find an adequate reason to vote for the bill \u2015 he said he plans to oppose the package when it comes before the House \u2015 but Gosar noted he could see how this deal works to Trump\u2019s favor if the president plays his hand right.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That part seems unlikely. Lawmakers have repeatedly noted in the last two days that Trump just set a precedent that will be tough for him to break: He supported raising the debt ceiling without concessions, and he has agreed to fund the government without demanding money for his border wall.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Gosar acknowledged that Trump has made his negotiating position more difficult. \u201cHe may have lost that credibility,\u201d Gosar said. \u201cBut time will tell.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, conservatives generally refused to blame Trump for a deal that most of them believe to be bad for Republicans. Many said they couldn\u2019t answer questions until actually seeing the text of the deal. Many outright refused to answer questions. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about whether Donald Trump or Paul Ryan did a good or bad job,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And many others made tenuous connections between the deal and Paul Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI just see that the leadership team signed off on it and the rest of us find out about it,\u201d said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). King noted that Ryan and other GOP leaders didn\u2019t ever offer a conservative alternative to a clean increase in the debt ceiling \u2015 again, an argument that isn\u2019t wrong but somehow ignores the fact that Trump jumped at the chance for a clean debt limit.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) conveyed that he was disappointed in the deal. But even after he was presented with the argument that Ryan had called the Democratic offer \u201cridiculous\u201d Wednesday morning shortly before Trump took the offer, Gohmert said Ryan may actually have been a proponent of the deal. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he was or not,\u201d the congressman said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderates generally welcomed Trump\u2019s deal, noting that the president had effectively cut out the Freedom Caucus from negotiations. \u201cTo me, the main positive of this deal is we\u2019re not gonna have one group of 30 or 40 have veto power,\u201d Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow a group of 30 or 40 to be setting policy for the House of Representatives.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as much as moderates were celebrating the compromised position of conservatives, conservatives were muted in their criticism \u2015 at least of Trump, who many believe is the key to overthrowing Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservatives have quietly been laying the groundwork for a coup against Ryan, pointing out with increasing frequency that the speaker had no plan to extract GOP concessions on the debt ceiling or a continuing resolution. But it\u2019s difficult to argue that this legislation is really Ryan\u2019s fault when Trump got out in front of it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have spun Trump\u2019s decision as one recognizing that Democrats were going to win this negotiation, so better to just \u201cclear the decks\u201d and perhaps allow Congress to focus on tax reform. But even that explanation is fraught. The short-term nature of the deal ensures that lawmakers will be focused on negotiating a broader deal in December, not just cutting taxes.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan\u2019s own defense of the agreement is that Trump saw a nation recovering from one hurricane and preparing for another, and he wanted a bipartisan moment rather than a protracted disagreement. That argument may work for some, but Trump has put Republicans in a bind for future negotiations, and he did so with little to no consultation from congressional leaders or his legislative affairs staff, according to one senior GOP aide familiar with discussions.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if Trump himself wanted to preserve his conservative credentials and damage Paul Ryan, he just went ahead and did the exact opposite. The question is whether that will matter to the far-right lawmakers who already seem to be plotting Ryan\u2019s fall.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gosar was asked Thursday if he still supports Ryan as speaker, he repeatedly answered that he hadn\u2019t said \u201cone way or another.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if he would welcome Ryan campaigning for him, Gosar answered that he didn\u2019t have a challenger. Asked whether he would let Ryan even fundraise for him, Gosar said he didn\u2019t know about that, noting that Ryan was \u201cvery unpopular\u201d in his district.</span></p>]

But she said on Friday that her bigger interest \u201clies with the young people whose futures are now being put in doubt and doing all we can to support and protect those young people.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are roughly 4,000 undocumented immigrants who attend schools in the University of California system, and Napolitano said on a call with reporters that a large proportion of them have DACA protections \u2015 so-called Dreamers. The state\u2019s university system also employs undocumented teachers, healthcare workers and other staff. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleges that Trump\u2019s </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decision to rescind the program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> violates the Administrative Procedure Act and constitutional due process, including that of students at University of California schools and the system itself. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe administration\u2019s approach in rescinding DACA was the opposite of reasoned decision-making and thus is unlawful,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cIt did not assess the costs of rescinding DACA to the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers or to the schools and communities in which they live, study and work.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit comes on the heels of a </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-against-trump-administration-daca_us_59b0453de4b0dfaafcf4fdd7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complaint by 15 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the District of Columbia and a challenge by a former recipient of the program. All are aiming to prevent Trump from ending DACA protections. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Napolitano\u2019s lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration illegally neglected to follow rules outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, which would have required more notice and a public comment period before making such a far-reaching change. Napolitano said that the situation was distinct from the creation of DACA, which did not go through a public comment period, because the program involved case-by-case determinations about prosecutorial discretion, while Trump\u2019s decision will hit recipients en masse. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u2033[Rescinding DACA] doesn\u2019t involve discretion at all,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cIt says that for this whole category of cases the administration will not exercise discretion and will not defer deportations. So it deals with this population and a whole category, not individuals.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that DACA is also distinct from the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA, which was blocked in the courts because of a lawsuit that alleged, in part, that the Obama administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act in creating it. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday\u2019s lawsuit also argues that the Trump administration violated the due process rights of DACA recipients, which are protected by the Fifth Amendment, by \u201cexecutive fiat.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those arguments also form part of the two other legal challenges to the termination of DACA filed in New York shortly after the Trump administration announced it would phase out the signature immigration reform of the Obama years. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those cases was originally filed in Brooklyn last year by DACA recipient Mart\xedn Jonathan Batalla Vidal. He had challenged the revocation of his three-year work authorization after the program\u2019s expansion was blocked by a federal judge in Texas, along with a farther-reaching program to shield undocumented parents of U.S. citizens from deportation. Lawyers in the Batalla Vidal case requested to amend their lawsuit to challenge the termination of DACA within hours of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement on Tuesday. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition of 15 states and the District of Columbia, led by New York, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-against-trump-administration-daca_us_59b0453de4b0dfaafcf4fdd7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a second lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0on Wednesday aimed at keeping DACA alive. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of the New York lawsuits allege that Trump\u2019s decision to end DACA was motivated by an intent to discriminate against Mexicans, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-lawsuit-trump_us_59b05150e4b0354e440f053a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">citing the vitriolic statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at Mexican immigrants that he made repeatedly on the campaign trail.

Now Jos\xe9, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/08/us/hurricane-jose/index.html" target="_blank">a Category 4 storm</a>, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0Katia, a <a href="http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2017/09/hurricane_katia_gulf_stronger.html" target="_blank">Category 3 storm</a>,\xa0are not far behind.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvey created unprecedented flooding in Texas,\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Irma is the most powerful tropical cyclone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever to take shape in the Atlantic Ocean. The French island of St. Martin has been 95 percent destroyed, according to local officials, and at least four people have died.\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devastation has led many to wonder what role climate change\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">may be playing in these powerful storms.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some political leaders are drawing a clear link between the two, such as Paris Mayor\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Anne_Hidalgo/status/905682345986056192" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne Hidalgo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who declared on Thursday that Irma is a \u201cconcrete manifestation\u201d of global warming. A few hours later, French President\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/TheDadGeeK/status/905757166912581635" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmanuel Macron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0said it was necessary to look at the \u201cdeep causes behind these types of events.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the connection between climate change and hurricanes is complicated, with several separate questions to consider. Is climate change causing more hurricanes (also called typhoons and cyclones, depending on where they originate)? Are the storms more powerful? Are they more destructive? And what does this portend for the future? </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see what science has to say, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">HuffPost France</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0interviewed Robert Vautard, a climatologist with France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research who specializes in the relationship between extreme events and climate change.</span></p>, <p>Researchers create mathematical models to test the ways that greenhouse gas emissions could evolve and to simulate the warming that could take place in the oceans and atmosphere. The models allow them to extrapolate how different weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, may develop in the future under varying temperature scenarios.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But so far, it\u2019s hard for the models to predict how rising temperatures will specifically affect storms. \u201cThe results lean toward a lessening in terms of the number of tropical storms and an increase in terms of wind force,\u201d Vautard said. \u201cBut there are a lot of uncertainties.\u201d</span></p>, <p>To be clear, the models are able to predict global climate scenarios with a high degree of accuracy. But predicting the evolution of storms requires even more precision, since they are only tiny events compared to the overall scale of the planet.\xa0Although there seem to be some consistencies in the storm models, their predictions can\u2019t be relied upon at this point.</p>, <p>Vautard and other scientists largely agree on one effect of climate change, however. \u201cThe impact tropical storms have is going to increase, because the atmosphere is going to warm up and will therefore contain more water,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means more rain.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more rain means more flooding, which can be just as damaging as a hurricane\u2019s strong winds, as Harvey demonstrated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another certainty is that climate change is causing sea levels to rise, which means greater storm surges and higher waves when a storm hits the coast.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cKnowing these two things, it\u2019s safe to say that hurricanes affecting low-elevation islands will therefore cause greater damage, even if they have the same features as today\u2019s do,\u201d said Vautard. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, even if scientists aren\u2019t sure about the number and potency of future tropical storms, they are fairly certain these storms will cause more damage if nothing is done to keep climate change in check. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvey caused historic flooding in Texas. Is this proof that global warming is already making hurricanes worse? The United Nations\u2019\xa0</span><a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-storm-harvey-un/storm-harveys-rainfall-likely-linked-to-climate-change-u-n-idUKKCN1B919O" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Meteorological Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and some </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/8/28/16213268/harvey-climate-change">American climatologists</a>\xa0say it is, absolutely.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0But Vautard doesn\u2019t want to be that assertive. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say. Worldwide, you could say that global warming has definitely caused an increase in rainfall, but in terms of Hurricane Harvey in particular, we\u2019ll have to wait on the studies being done right now,\u201d he said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate science is much more about examining what happens on a global multiyear average scale \u2015 not about specific events. Researchers will be studying Harvey and looking at how it fits into broader trends,\xa0Vautard said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as tropical storms are concerned,\xa0it\u2019s also difficult to know what the historic trends have been. \u201cSince they mostly happen at sea, you need satellite data to get statistics about hurricanes,\u201d said Vautard. But that type of data has only been around for about 40 years, which is not long enough to establish reliable scientific models. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, researchers will continue to improve the precision of their models, which will allow them to better understand how and why hurricanes form, and how climate factors contribute to that.\xa0\u201cWe aren\u2019t far off,\u201d Vautard said.</span></p>, <p><em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/09/06/ouragans-harvey-irma-jose-la-faute-au-rechauffement-climatique-cest-plus-complique-que-ca_a_23198411/" target="_blank">This story was first published by HuffPost France.</a></em></p>]

In his statement, King wrote that while there may be some people who voted twice, there were thousands more who were removed from the rolls for no reason or had their vote suppressed. King won\u2019t be attending the panel\u2019s Tuesday meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, because of a scheduling conflict, he told commission organizers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe reality is that the less affluent in our society are more prone to move and more prone to have a diminished economic position in life, just to survive. But that does not mean that officials in government should \u2018game the system\u2019 to deprive the less affluent from voting, simply because they may have moved from one election to another only to be stricken from the active voter list,\u201d he wrote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King\u2019s comments are significant because they are some of the toughest comments from a sitting commission member pushing back on the suggestion that widespread voter fraud is a problem. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the commission\u2019s vice chair, <a href="http://www.kansas.com/site-services/databases/article37140699.html" target="_blank">supports a Kansas law</a> that puts people on a suspense list if they fail to show proof of citizenship when they register. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/lawyer-behind-nationwide-voter-purge-effort-named-to-trump-election-commission/" target="_blank">J.

It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to realize that those that are affluent have a more stable type of residential situation and home life. And this is about disenfranchising, in my opinion, those perhaps who live in apartment complexes, who are maybe less educated, who maybe for whatever reason in life, they\u2019re not at a level that some people are. That\u2019s what this is about,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just me. But I do have almost 17 years of nuts and bolts experience in elections...It\u2019s clear to me that there is an agenda to deprive people of the right to vote and that is wrong.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King declined to clarify whether he was speaking specifically about Trump\u2019s commission, which critics fear will lead to widespread voter purging. That alarm was heightened when the Department of Justice sent out an unusual letter in June to\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/department-of-justice-voter-purge_us_595d22b1e4b0da2c7326c38b">44 states asking for compliance</a>\xa0with voter purge policies. The letter went out the same day Kobach sent a letter to election officials across the country requesting voter information, but the Department of Justice says the two requests are unrelated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats serving on the commission\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-gardner-new-hampshire-voter-fraud-commission_us_59b2fea1e4b0354e4411f55d">face calls to resign</a>\xa0and accusations that they are enabling an effort to weaken confidence in the American electoral system. Several have resisted those calls, saying it\u2019s better to have a seat at the table.</span></p>, <p>King said he still wants more information on what the final product of the commission\u2019s work will look like. Several commissioners have said they\u2019ve had little contact with the commission and are unsure of what Kobach has been working on since its last meeting.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWho is going to write this recommendation, when will the recommendation be written and will all members of the commission have input into the final recommendation?,\u201d King said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King added he believed he saw protecting the right to vote as crucial to America\u2019s future. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou can call it voter suppression, someone can name it whatever they want, it\u2019s about treating all people fairly and understanding the importance of the right to vote. And understanding the importance of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take away the right to vote for hundreds of thousands of people and you\u2019re destroying the will of the people. And once the will of the people is destroyed, then I truly believe this nation will fall.\u201d</span></p>]

Here’s Why It’s Hard To Say.</h1>|[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PARIS \u2015 There\u2019s a bit of an apocalyptic vibe in the air. Even though it\u2019s tropical storm season, it has been alarming to watch\xa0</span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/hurricanes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hurricanes</span></a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/hurricane-harvey" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/hurricane-irma" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strike land in rapid succession. Now Jos\xe9, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/08/us/hurricane-jose/index.html" target="_blank">a Category 4 storm</a>, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0Katia, a <a href="http://www.nola.com/hurricane/index.ssf/2017/09/hurricane_katia_gulf_stronger.html" target="_blank">Category 3 storm</a>,\xa0are not far behind.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvey created unprecedented flooding in Texas,\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Irma is the most powerful tropical cyclone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever to take shape in the Atlantic Ocean. The French island of St. Martin has been 95 percent destroyed, according to local officials, and at least four people have died.\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devastation has led many to wonder what role climate change\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">may be playing in these powerful storms.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some political leaders are drawing a clear link between the two, such as Paris Mayor\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Anne_Hidalgo/status/905682345986056192" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne Hidalgo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who declared on Thursday that Irma is a \u201cconcrete manifestation\u201d of global warming. A few hours later, French President\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/TheDadGeeK/status/905757166912581635" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmanuel Macron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0said it was necessary to look at the \u201cdeep causes behind these types of events.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the connection between climate change and hurricanes is complicated, with several separate questions to consider. Is climate change causing more hurricanes (also called typhoons and cyclones, depending on where they originate)? Are the storms more powerful? Are they more destructive? And what does this portend for the future? </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see what science has to say, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">HuffPost France</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0interviewed Robert Vautard, a climatologist with France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research who specializes in the relationship between extreme events and climate change.</span></p>, <p>Researchers create mathematical models to test the ways that greenhouse gas emissions could evolve and to simulate the warming that could take place in the oceans and atmosphere. The models allow them to extrapolate how different weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, may develop in the future under varying temperature scenarios.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But so far, it\u2019s hard for the models to predict how rising temperatures will specifically affect storms. \u201cThe results lean toward a lessening in terms of the number of tropical storms and an increase in terms of wind force,\u201d Vautard said. \u201cBut there are a lot of uncertainties.\u201d</span></p>, <p>To be clear, the models are able to predict global climate scenarios with a high degree of accuracy. But predicting the evolution of storms requires even more precision, since they are only tiny events compared to the overall scale of the planet.\xa0Although there seem to be some consistencies in the storm models, their predictions can\u2019t be relied upon at this point.</p>, <p>Vautard and other scientists largely agree on one effect of climate change, however. \u201cThe impact tropical storms have is going to increase, because the atmosphere is going to warm up and will therefore contain more water,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means more rain.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more rain means more flooding, which can be just as damaging as a hurricane\u2019s strong winds, as Harvey demonstrated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another certainty is that climate change is causing sea levels to rise, which means greater storm surges and higher waves when a storm hits the coast.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cKnowing these two things, it\u2019s safe to say that hurricanes affecting low-elevation islands will therefore cause greater damage, even if they have the same features as today\u2019s do,\u201d said Vautard. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, even if scientists aren\u2019t sure about the number and potency of future tropical storms, they are fairly certain these storms will cause more damage if nothing is done to keep climate change in check. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvey caused historic flooding in Texas. Is this proof that global warming is already making hurricanes worse? The United Nations\u2019\xa0</span><a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-storm-harvey-un/storm-harveys-rainfall-likely-linked-to-climate-change-u-n-idUKKCN1B919O" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Meteorological Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and some </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/8/28/16213268/harvey-climate-change">American climatologists</a>\xa0say it is, absolutely.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0But Vautard doesn\u2019t want to be that assertive. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say. Worldwide, you could say that global warming has definitely caused an increase in rainfall, but in terms of Hurricane Harvey in particular, we\u2019ll have to wait on the studies being done right now,\u201d he said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate science is much more about examining what happens on a global multiyear average scale \u2015 not about specific events. Researchers will be studying Harvey and looking at how it fits into broader trends,\xa0Vautard said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as tropical storms are concerned,\xa0it\u2019s also difficult to know what the historic trends have been. \u201cSince they mostly happen at sea, you need satellite data to get statistics about hurricanes,\u201d said Vautard. But that type of data has only been around for about 40 years, which is not long enough to establish reliable scientific models. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, researchers will continue to improve the precision of their models, which will allow them to better understand how and why hurricanes form, and how climate factors contribute to that.\xa0\u201cWe aren\u2019t far off,\u201d Vautard said.</span></p>, <p><em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/09/06/ouragans-harvey-irma-jose-la-faute-au-rechauffement-climatique-cest-plus-complique-que-ca_a_23198411/" target="_blank">This story was first published by HuffPost France.</a></em></p>]

In his statement, King wrote that while there may be some people who voted twice, there were thousands more who were removed from the rolls for no reason or had their vote suppressed. King won\u2019t be attending the panel\u2019s Tuesday meeting in Manchester, New Hampshire, because of a scheduling conflict, he told commission organizers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe reality is that the less affluent in our society are more prone to move and more prone to have a diminished economic position in life, just to survive. But that does not mean that officials in government should \u2018game the system\u2019 to deprive the less affluent from voting, simply because they may have moved from one election to another only to be stricken from the active voter list,\u201d he wrote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King\u2019s comments are significant because they are some of the toughest comments from a sitting commission member pushing back on the suggestion that widespread voter fraud is a problem. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the commission\u2019s vice chair, <a href="http://www.kansas.com/site-services/databases/article37140699.html" target="_blank">supports a Kansas law</a> that puts people on a suspense list if they fail to show proof of citizenship when they register. <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/lawyer-behind-nationwide-voter-purge-effort-named-to-trump-election-commission/" target="_blank">J.

It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to realize that those that are affluent have a more stable type of residential situation and home life. And this is about disenfranchising, in my opinion, those perhaps who live in apartment complexes, who are maybe less educated, who maybe for whatever reason in life, they\u2019re not at a level that some people are. That\u2019s what this is about,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just me. But I do have almost 17 years of nuts and bolts experience in elections...It\u2019s clear to me that there is an agenda to deprive people of the right to vote and that is wrong.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King declined to clarify whether he was speaking specifically about Trump\u2019s commission, which critics fear will lead to widespread voter purging. That alarm was heightened when the Department of Justice sent out an unusual letter in June to\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/department-of-justice-voter-purge_us_595d22b1e4b0da2c7326c38b">44 states asking for compliance</a>\xa0with voter purge policies. The letter went out the same day Kobach sent a letter to election officials across the country requesting voter information, but the Department of Justice says the two requests are unrelated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats serving on the commission\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-gardner-new-hampshire-voter-fraud-commission_us_59b2fea1e4b0354e4411f55d">face calls to resign</a>\xa0and accusations that they are enabling an effort to weaken confidence in the American electoral system. Several have resisted those calls, saying it\u2019s better to have a seat at the table.</span></p>, <p>King said he still wants more information on what the final product of the commission\u2019s work will look like. Several commissioners have said they\u2019ve had little contact with the commission and are unsure of what Kobach has been working on since its last meeting.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWho is going to write this recommendation, when will the recommendation be written and will all members of the commission have input into the final recommendation?,\u201d King said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King added he believed he saw protecting the right to vote as crucial to America\u2019s future. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou can call it voter suppression, someone can name it whatever they want, it\u2019s about treating all people fairly and understanding the importance of the right to vote. And understanding the importance of democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take away the right to vote for hundreds of thousands of people and you\u2019re destroying the will of the people. And once the will of the people is destroyed, then I truly believe this nation will fall.\u201d</span></p>]

That represents a departure from \u201cOregon\u2019s long bipartisan tradition of working together to identify the most qualified candidates for judicial vacancies,\u201d they said.\xa0</span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen.

The French island of St. Martin has been 95 percent destroyed, according to local officials, and at least four people have died.\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The devastation has led many to wonder what role climate change\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">may be playing in these powerful storms.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some political leaders are drawing a clear link between the two, such as Paris Mayor\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Anne_Hidalgo/status/905682345986056192" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anne Hidalgo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who declared on Thursday that Irma is a \u201cconcrete manifestation\u201d of global warming. A few hours later, French President\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/TheDadGeeK/status/905757166912581635" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emmanuel Macron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0said it was necessary to look at the \u201cdeep causes behind these types of events.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the connection between climate change and hurricanes is complicated, with several separate questions to consider. Is climate change causing more hurricanes (also called typhoons and cyclones, depending on where they originate)? Are the storms more powerful? Are they more destructive? And what does this portend for the future? </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To see what science has to say, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">HuffPost France</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0interviewed Robert Vautard, a climatologist with France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research who specializes in the relationship between extreme events and climate change.</span></p>, <p>Researchers create mathematical models to test the ways that greenhouse gas emissions could evolve and to simulate the warming that could take place in the oceans and atmosphere. The models allow them to extrapolate how different weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, may develop in the future under varying temperature scenarios.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But so far, it\u2019s hard for the models to predict how rising temperatures will specifically affect storms. \u201cThe results lean toward a lessening in terms of the number of tropical storms and an increase in terms of wind force,\u201d Vautard said. \u201cBut there are a lot of uncertainties.\u201d</span></p>, <p>To be clear, the models are able to predict global climate scenarios with a high degree of accuracy. But predicting the evolution of storms requires even more precision, since they are only tiny events compared to the overall scale of the planet.\xa0Although there seem to be some consistencies in the storm models, their predictions can\u2019t be relied upon at this point.</p>, <p>Vautard and other scientists largely agree on one effect of climate change, however. \u201cThe impact tropical storms have is going to increase, because the atmosphere is going to warm up and will therefore contain more water,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means more rain.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And more rain means more flooding, which can be just as damaging as a hurricane\u2019s strong winds, as Harvey demonstrated.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another certainty is that climate change is causing sea levels to rise, which means greater storm surges and higher waves when a storm hits the coast.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cKnowing these two things, it\u2019s safe to say that hurricanes affecting low-elevation islands will therefore cause greater damage, even if they have the same features as today\u2019s do,\u201d said Vautard. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, even if scientists aren\u2019t sure about the number and potency of future tropical storms, they are fairly certain these storms will cause more damage if nothing is done to keep climate change in check. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvey caused historic flooding in Texas. Is this proof that global warming is already making hurricanes worse? The United Nations\u2019\xa0</span><a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-storm-harvey-un/storm-harveys-rainfall-likely-linked-to-climate-change-u-n-idUKKCN1B919O" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">World Meteorological Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and some </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/8/28/16213268/harvey-climate-change">American climatologists</a>\xa0say it is, absolutely.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0But Vautard doesn\u2019t want to be that assertive. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say. Worldwide, you could say that global warming has definitely caused an increase in rainfall, but in terms of Hurricane Harvey in particular, we\u2019ll have to wait on the studies being done right now,\u201d he said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate science is much more about examining what happens on a global multiyear average scale \u2015 not about specific events. Researchers will be studying Harvey and looking at how it fits into broader trends,\xa0Vautard said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as tropical storms are concerned,\xa0it\u2019s also difficult to know what the historic trends have been. \u201cSince they mostly happen at sea, you need satellite data to get statistics about hurricanes,\u201d said Vautard. But that type of data has only been around for about 40 years, which is not long enough to establish reliable scientific models. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, researchers will continue to improve the precision of their models, which will allow them to better understand how and why hurricanes form, and how climate factors contribute to that.\xa0\u201cWe aren\u2019t far off,\u201d Vautard said.</span></p>, <p><em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/09/06/ouragans-harvey-irma-jose-la-faute-au-rechauffement-climatique-cest-plus-complique-que-ca_a_23198411/" target="_blank">This story was first published by HuffPost France.</a></em></p>]

Max Baucus (D-Mont.), a fiscal moderate who, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presided over the passage of the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/affordable-care-act" target="_blank">Affordable Care Act</a>, expressed his support on Thursday for the creation of a single-payer health care system.</p>, <p>\u201cMy personal view is we\u2019ve got to start looking at single-payer,\u201d Baucus said in remarks at Montana State University, according to the\xa0<a href="http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/baucus-backs-single-payer-health-system/article_e481abc1-3bf0-55f2-a49e-c9786a1f11a6.html" target="_blank">Bozeman Daily Chronicle</a>. \u201cI think we should have hearings... We\u2019re getting there. It\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p>, <p>Single-payer health care, in which the federal government insures all citizens through one large program, is a model for universal coverage in many developed countries, including Canada, France and Australia. But it has long been viewed as a pipe dream in the United States, where a <a href="http://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank">plurality of people</a> receive coverage from their employers.</p>, <p>Baucus\u2019 endorsement of the idea speaks to just how dramatically the health policy debate has shifted within the Democratic Party in recent years \u2015 particularly since the 2016 presidential run of Sen. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/bernie-sanders" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.), who made what he called \u201cMedicare for all\u201d a central issue of his campaign.</p>, <p>Baucus was the subject of <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/why-liberals-hate-max-baucus" target="_blank">progressive frustration</a> for his stewardship of the ACA, also known as Obamacare. Critics argued that he held the bill in committee far too long in hopes of winning the support of moderate Republicans who did not end up voting for the final bill. The lengthy negotiation period he initiated gave Republicans much-needed time to mobilize opposition to reform, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/04/23/max-baucus-mixed-legacy/?utm_term=.2e78cb9b88f8" target="_blank">Baucus\u2019 detractors</a>.</p>, <p>Obamacare itself relies on a hybrid model, once favored by conservative policy experts, that combines the creation of a new private, individual insurance marketplace and an expansion of Medicaid.</p>, <p>Given Baucus\u2019 history as a fiscal moderate active in the ACA\u2019s passage, his positive remarks about single-payer could provide a boost to progressive activists agitating for its implementation.</p>, <p>As Senate Finance Committee chairman, Baucus ruled out consideration of single-payer from the beginning, and declined to invite the testimony of single-payer advocates at hearings. The latter decision prompted disruptive protests from activists, and Baucus later said that\xa0<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/baucus-soothes-single-payer-backers-023293" target="_blank">he regretted</a> not engaging more with the policy\u2019s proponents.</p>, <p>In September 2009, Baucus also voted against <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/health/policy/30health.html?mcubz=3" target="_blank">two amendments</a> that would have created a public health insurance option on the Obamacare individual insurance exchanges.</p>, <p>Baucus kept single-payer off the table during the development of Obamacare because he believed the country was not ready for it at the time, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sanders-steps-push-single-payer-health-care-old-foe-switches-n799911" target="_blank">he told NBC News on Friday</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI just think the time has come,\u201d Baucus said. \u201cBack in \u201909, we were not ready to address it. It would never have passed. Here we are nine years later, I think it\u2019s time to hopefully have a very serious good faith look at it.\u201d</p>, <p>Sen. Jon Tester\xa0(D-Mont.), a moderate who represented Montana alongside Baucus from 2007 to 2014, also expressed openness to single-payer this week.</p>, <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s something we should, quite frankly, take a solid look at,\u201d <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/349493-centrist-dem-maybe-we-should-look-at-single-payer-healthcare" target="_blank">Tester said Wednesday.</a></p>, <p>Tester does not support single-payer legislation, however. When Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), aiming to put Democrats in an awkward political position, introduced a trick amendment creating a single-payer system to the Obamacare repeal bill, most Democratic senators voted \u201cpresent\u201d on the motion, but Tester was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-single-payer-amendment_us_597a19e1e4b02a4ebb73d2f6">one of four Democratic senators to vote \u201cno\u201d</a>\xa0on it.</p>, <p>Former Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) \u2015 a moderate who vehemently opposed creating a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/21/budget-buster-kent-conrad_n_264123.html">public health insurance option</a> during the passage of Obamacare \u2015 told HuffPost that unlike Baucus, he believes it is \u201cunlikely we will get a single-payer system in the foreseeable future.\u201d</p>, <p>Single-payer is improbable, Conrad argued, because funding a federal health insurance program would cost taxpayers so much and because medical providers are so opposed to radically transforming the system.\xa0</p>, <p>Instead, he said, the \u201cbest system combines universal coverage with private not-for-profit insurance with the government assisting those who cannot afford insurance.\u201d</p>, <p>He also favors empowering Medicare to negotiate bulk discounts on prescription drugs, just as the Veterans Affairs health care system does.</p>, <p>In addition to Sanders\u2019 presidential run, the collapse of Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare has increased grassroots energy behind single-payer as activists seek to go on the offensive. Progressive pressure groups like <a href="https://credoaction.com/" target="_blank">Credo</a> have launched efforts to make support for the policy a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-progressives-double-push-single-payer_us_5980ebdfe4b0353fbb33406b" target="_blank">litmus test</a> for 2020\u2032s Democratic presidential candidates.</p>, <p>Single-payer now has more support in Congress than at any other time in recent history. Single-payer legislation introduced by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-conyers-single-payer-health-care-political-winner_us_5925a104e4b00c8df2a0da51" target="_blank">Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.)</a> has more co-sponsors than ever, with the support of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus.</p>, <p>Sanders plans to unveil a much-anticipated version of single-payer legislation next Wednesday. Sens. <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2009/06/baucus-soothes-single-payer-backers-023293" target="_blank">Kamala Harris</a> (D-Calif.), a rumored 2020 presidential contender, and <a href="https://www.elizabethwarren.com/blog/medicare-for-all" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) have already announced plans to co-sponsor the bill.</p>, <p>Polling suggests that the idea of single-payer is popular with the public, especially among Democrats. In a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx" target="_blank">May 2016 Gallup poll</a>, 58 percent of Americans and 73 percent of Democrats said they supported replacing \u201cthe ACA with a federally funded healthcare program providing insurance for all Americans.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Even elected Democrats who remain wary of single-payer have begun trying to capitalize on the ambitious proposal\u2019s popularity. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus\u2019 political action committee, Bold PAC, has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hispanic-caucus-raises-money-off-single-payer_us_59af24d9e4b0354e440d7c01?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004" target="_blank">repeatedly alluded to the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d fight</a> in fundraising e-mails \u2015 even though half of the 30 CHC members have yet to actually endorse single-payer, and the PAC does not make support for the policy a condition for its financial support.</p>, <p>Of course,\xa0it is much easier to talk about single-payer than to actually implement it. Replacing the current system with one large federal program would require a massive tax increase in exchange for what advocates believe would result in net cost reductions thanks to the government\u2019s considerable bargaining power.</p>, <p>It would also force the nearly half of Americans who get insurance from their jobs to enroll in a new government program. Given the outcry that Obamacare elicited for canceling the plans of a fraction of that number of people, enacting single-payer would likely prove an extraordinary political challenge.</p>, <p>In the meantime, though, the excitement around single-payer has already widened the spectrum of acceptable debate about health care.\xa0Expansions of coverage that once seemed radical now seem downright moderate by comparison. In August, Sen. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/22/16171160/schatz-health-care-medicaid" target="_blank">Brian Schatz</a> (D-Hawaii) announced plans to introduce legislation allowing Americans of all ages and incomes to buy into Medicaid. And earlier this week, Sen. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/8/16275998/chris-murphy-single-payer" target="_blank">Chris Murphy</a> (D-Conn.) revealed his intention to introduce a bill creating a comparable universal buy-in option for Medicare, which he said\xa0\u201cmay be the fastest way to a single-payer system.\u201d</p>, <p><em>This article has been updated with comments from Tester and Conrad, as well as additional comments from Baucus.</em></p>]

The school year has just begun and he already has a lot on his mind.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019d be a very traumatic experience for the kids,\u201d a concerned Djiwandana, who teaches 8th grade math and special education classes in the Bronx,\xa0told HuffPost.\xa0\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a teacher quit for personal reasons or for a teacher to get fired. But it\u2019s another thing for a teacher to be physically taken from the classroom or the school community.\u201d</p>, <p>Djiwandana represents a significant number of DACA recipients, or \u201cDACAmented\u201d people,\xa0who have gone into the education field. More than a fifth of recipients are employed in educational and health services, <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2016/10/18/146290/new-study-of-daca-beneficiaries-shows-positive-economic-and-educational-outcomes/" target="_blank">a survey showed</a>.\xa0In fact, Teach For America alone has employed nearly 200 Dreamers who have <a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/top-stories/daca-dream-act-how-you-can-stand-tfa-dreamer-teachers-and-undocumented-students" target="_blank">served more than 10,000 </a>students.\xa0</p>, <p>Djiwandana\u2019s parents brought him to Los Angeles when he was 4 months old, and like many immigrant parents, they hoped their son would receive a good education and a stable future in America. Growing up, the teacher didn\u2019t question his own status or background much. He didn\u2019t stick out as a person of color or an immigrant as his neighborhood was predominantly Asian and Latino. While his parents dropped hints about his status, like dodging questions about going back to visit Indonesia, he only discovered he was undocumented when applying for college financial aid.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWhen I asked my parents for a lot of the forms, which included a copy of a green card or an American passport, they told me that we didn\u2019t have them,\u201d Djiwandana, a Georgetown University graduate, explained. \u201cThat\u2019s when I figured out I was undocumented.\u201d</p>, <p>Luckily, his status wasn\u2019t a hindrance to his admission to the school or to receiving an appropriate financial aid package, since the university provides <a href="https://undocumented.georgetown.edu/" target="_blank">services to undocumented students</a>. He enrolled in DACA his freshman year and though it hadn\u2019t occurred to him at the time, the program would end up being a lifeline for him as he prepared to enter the workforce.<strong>\xa0</strong>While there are still limitations on the jobs he is eligible to apply for,\xa0the program has opened him up to several options and thankfully, teaching in New York was one of them.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI would honestly probably be chilling at home, trying to get a job under the table,\u201d he says.\xa0</p>, <p>Djiwandana currently teaches in a public school that serves mostly low-income families of color. And in many schools in urban, communities of color, the teacher turnover rate is high.\xa0Across the country, high-poverty, high-minority urban schools are suffering with a turnover rate of almost 20 percent annually. And according to the National School Boards Association, up to half of new teachers leave the profession within their first five years. Teacher turnover isn\u2019t cheap either.\xa0It could cost the nation\u2019s public schools more than $7.3 billion a year, the <a href="https://nctaf.org/wp-content/uploads/NCTAFCostofTeacherTurnoverpolicybrief.pdf" target="_blank">National Commission On Teaching And America\u2019s Future</a> indicated.\xa0</p>, <p><a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/join-tfa/is-tfa-for-me/dacamented-teachers" target="_blank">DACAmented teachers</a>, particularly the ones in the TFA program, often teach at these very urban institutions. And many of them want to be there. Djiwandana says that so many of the teachers can relate to their students\u2019 backgrounds. They\u2019ve lived it. He explained that many of his own pupils come from immigrant families like he does and often don\u2019t have college-educated parents. As a first-generation college student himself, he\u2019s familiar with the added obstacles kids face when their families aren\u2019t proficient in the U.S. education system.\xa0</p>, <p>In the classroom, Djiwandana tries to explain the college application process to the students, relaying how difficult the pathway can be when they don\u2019t personally know anyone who\u2019s gone through it. Other times, he\u2019ll remind the pupils about how crucial it is to get homework help \u2015 whether it\u2019s from a teacher or someone in the community \u2015 if their parents are unable to assist them. He says that oftentimes these students simply lack access to pertinent information.</p>, <p>He\u2019s there to help fill in the gaps.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s similar things that I can relate to, being a first-generation American or student from a low-income working class background,\u201d he says,\xa0explaining that his own parents weren\u2019t able to help him with algebra or other subjects growing up \u2015 not because they didn\u2019t want to but because they just didn\u2019t know how.\xa0</p>, <p>Djiwandana adds that his background also helps him empathize with the pupils\u2019 emotional challenges\xa0\u2015 particularly during a time when he feels immigrants are under attack. Following the string of attempted <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-deportation-raids_us_58a21416e4b03df370d912df">crackdowns</a> on\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/raise-act-asian-americans_us_598369ade4b0cb15b1bd456c">legal </a>and illegal immigration, Djiwandana says his students have a pessimistic view of the administration. The students may not understand the specifics of their policies, he says, but they, too, feel the fear in their immigrant communities.\xa0</p>, <p>The 22-year-old, who renewed his DACA permit a few months ago, told HuffPost it expires in 2019. While Trump allegedly told House Minority Leader<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pelosi-trump-dream-act_us_59b1640be4b0354e440ff994">\xa0Nancy Pelosi\xa0(D-Calif.)</a> that he\u2019d support and sign the Dream Act, which would give legal status to young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, Djiwandana feels uncertain of what the future holds. However, he believes it\u2019s important to be present for his students.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI see a lot of myself in my students and partially because of that I think it\u2019s important for me to stay strong. But it\u2019s also important for me to be vulnerable and human so my students can also see themselves in me,\u201d he says of the situation.\xa0</p>, <p>But one thing Djiwandana knows for sure. Immigrants aren\u2019t so easily broken.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThe immigrant community is super resilient. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m optimistic about, it\u2019s that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no doubt that documented and undocumented immigrants will find ways to fight back and hold leaders accountable.\u201d\xa0\xa0</p>]

I think about DACA, about the benefits it gave me to be able to continue my studies, to be employed by a home loan business, thanks to which I could buy a home for my parents who left Mexico City. And now what? We are in this limbo over what will happen to us.\u201d</p>, <p>Isaac Montiel, a 27-year-old student born in Puebla, Mexico, followed Sessions\u2019 announcement via social media while protesting outside the White House.</p>, <p>Montiel co-chairs the\xa0<a href="http://www.cunydreamers.org/">CUNY Dreamers</a>\xa0group and is one of 28 Dreamers on a four-day hunger strike. \u201cI am angry, frustrated, but I also want to continue fighting for a permanent solution from Congress,\u201d he said.\xa0</p>, <p>Individuals who currently have DACA protections will begin to lose their work permits in six months, putting hundreds of thousands of young U.S. residents at risk of being sent away from the country they\u2019ve lived in since they were children \u2015 unless members of the U.S. House and Senate can agree on legislation to protect them.\xa0</p>, <p>Mexico City-born Jos\xe9 Eduardo Morales, who now lives in Utah, wasn\u2019t surprised by the decision.\xa0\u201cI already knew what was going to happen, but it was difficult to process,\u201d Morales said. \u201cI felt a little disoriented, defenseless, uncertain. My permit is still valid for a year, and right now I am completing a graduate degree in education.\u201d</p>, <p>Morales said that while he can\u2019t travel to Washington D.C. to take part in protests, he\u2019s using the tools at his disposal to support them. He says the\xa0<a href="https://www.usmexicofound.org/">U.S.-Mexico Foundation</a>\xa0has advised Dreamers to stay on top of the news, and that they\u2019re also staying connected through WhatsApp.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThis is causing us emotional and physical stress,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I have two more years left to complete my studies and if I can complete them, I will use my graduate degree here to help my community in many ways.\u201d</p>, <p>Rebecca Vargas, who co-chairs the\xa0<a href="https://www.usmexicofound.org/">U.S.-Mexico Foundation</a>, said dialogue and educating members of Congress will be crucial in the weeks and months ahead. \u201cThe only benefit of this announcement is that if we achieve something in Congress, it should be permanent, not temporary, as DACA was,\u201d she explained.\xa0</p>, <p>Amid the insecurity about what lies ahead, Dreamers have expressed a wide range of fears, including whether they\u2019d be at risk of deportation and whether the U.S. government will make use of the data they provided when they applied for the program, including their place of residence, work or school.\xa0\xa0</p>, <p>Eunice Rend\xf3n, director of <a href="http://agendamigrante.mx/">Agenda Migrante</a>, said that an additional worry is the Mexican government\u2019s lack of sufficient preparation for the possible return of these young people.</p>, <p>\u201cMexico is not completely ready to receive [so many] of these young people. There are efforts and political willingness, but I do not see a comprehensive return policy,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to be clear on the fact that U.S. legislators \u2015 who ultimately will be the ones to resolve these young people\u2019s current situation \u2015 can also be pressured via the media and social justice groups.\u201d</p>, <p>Rend\xf3n also noted Dreamers\u2019 contributions to the U.S. economy \u2015 according to the Center for American Progress,\xa0deporting Dreamers will result in a <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2017/07/21/436419/new-threat-daca-cost-states-billions-dollars/" target="_blank">$460 billion loss</a> to the U.S. GDP over the next 10 years.</p>, <p>\u201cMore than <a href="https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2017/08/27164928/Wong-Et-Al-New-DACA-Survey-2017-Codebook.pdf" target="_blank">98 percent of them are bilingual, 91 percent are formally employed, and 70 percent have completed higher education</a>," Rend\xf3n said. "They are the ideal citizen for any country! Trump may have a majority in Congress, but we have not forgotten that there are many Republicans who have voted against his decisions.\u201d <strong>\xa0</strong></p>, <p>That\u2019s why Montiel did not await Session\u2019s announcement in New York, where he lives, but in Washington, D.C., where he traveled to lend his voice to the chorus of protesters. \u201cWe are not giving up! Hopefully the Mexican government will announce their support for us. Thinking about returning [to Mexico] would be one of my last alternatives,\u201d he said.\xa0</p>, <p>Alem\xe1n echoed his sentiment. \u201cFor my family, it would be very difficult to return to our country,\u201d she acknowledged, \u201cbut most of all for me, who grew up in this country.

He would evade the question with what he thought was the only plausible defense: He cared deeply about global warming, he told them. Twelve years later, he laughs at his attempt at that moral argument, which was simply a cover-up for the fact that he\u2019s an undocumented immigrant and had no way of getting an ID.</p>, <p>\u201cI learned to really hide myself,\u201d Choi, who\u2019s from Seoul, South Korea, and lives in New York,\xa0told HuffPost. \u201cIt definitely didn\u2019t feel good. It made me scared. My sister would say, \u2018If you stand out too much, they\u2019ll take you away.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>These memories came back to Choi, now 28, on Tuesday, when Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> was nixing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, ending protections for some 800,000 undocumented immigrants who came to the country as minors. The program, originally enacted under former President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a> and now in Congress\u2019 hands, shielded young people from deportation and allowed them to work in the country legally.\xa0</p>, <p>Besides being undocumented, Choi is also gay. He points out there is more at stake for people who could be forced to go back to a country that isn\u2019t big on LGBTQ rights. He notes that\xa0<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/01/opinions/south-korea-military-sodomy-law/index.html" target="_blank">military service is compulsory in South Korea</a>\xa0for men \u2015 and the military penal code prohibits consensual same-sex acts. \xa0\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cFor a lot of us, going back to our home countries isn\u2019t an option because of our queerness,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I were to go to Korea, I would have to do the two-year mandatory service in the military, and the law prohibits sodomy.\u201d</p>, <p>Choi came to the U.S. from Seoul when he was 8 years old. His parents\u2019 lumber business had folded due to the global financial crisis, he said. They lived in Hawaii for a year and eventually moved to Bergen County, New Jersey. His father worked construction jobs and his mother worked as a restaurant server and in a nail salon.</p>, <p>He remembers specific anecdotes that highlighted the fact he was undocumented, though he said he didn\u2019t understand it at the time. He couldn\u2019t cross the border to the Canadian side of Niagara Falls during a family trip in fifth grade. And when it was time to take the PSAT and he asked his mother for his Social Security number, she simply told him he didn\u2019t have one.</p>, <p>As Choi got older, his parents divorced and his mother suffered arthritis from her nail technician work. She\u2019s also a breast cancer survivor, which meant she couldn\u2019t work for a sustained period of their family\u2019s life in the U.S.</p>, <p>Before DACA, Choi could only work cash-under-the-table jobs, and he earned $5 an hour at a sushi takeout restaurant after college. He contributed what he could to his mom, who was reliant on her children\u2019s salaries.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cEven if I don\u2019t get deported, I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be relegated to living that kind of life again,\u201d Choi said.\xa0</p>, <p>Currently, his mother hasn\u2019t quite accepted the potential consequences of Tuesday\u2019s decision.</p>, <p>\u201cMy mom says, \u2018They wouldn\u2019t do this to you.\u2019 She cited examples of Trump saying he was sympathetic to our plight,\u201d Choi told HuffPost. \u201cI say Trump didn\u2019t even have the courage to say he was rescinding DACA.\xa0He sent a surrogate \u2015 he sent Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III. Trump\u2019s not with us.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Choi entered college in 2008 at a small school in Kentucky called Berea College. He received full tuition coverage as part of a pilot program for undocumented students.\xa0\xa0</p>, <p>He said he felt grateful and enjoyed his time but felt like he was living a really singular experience without a community of other Asians, and it was extremely isolating.\xa0Fear took a toll on his mental health.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI heard about immigration raids. It started giving me nightmares,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up in Korea. Now I\u2019m in Kentucky, where there weren\u2019t other Asians like me. I would have panic attacks and nightmares about ICE raiding my door.\u201d</p>, <p>He said he finally started opening up to school leaders and friends, asking for help and also spreading awareness about what he was facing.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWhat I didn\u2019t realize I was doing was organizing,\u201d he said. \u201cI was essentially the first immigrant rights organizer at my school.\u201d</p>, <p>He said he connected with other immigrant groups in Kentucky after that and really \u201ccame out\u201d as undocumented in 2011 at a conference in Memphis.\xa0</p>, <p>Choi now works as a social media manager for <a href="https://18millionrising.org/index.html" target="_blank">18 Million Rising</a>, an Asian-American/Pacific Islander<strong>\xa0</strong>activism community. Prior to that, he was an organizer with the Women\u2019s March. He points out that issues related to immigration, queer, women and minority rights are all related,\xa0and that more people should be aware of that.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cA lot of times when people think about immigration, there\u2019s a stereotypical immigrant in their minds,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are undocumented folks from all corners of the planet living in the U.S. We don\u2019t follow the exact same story. We\u2019re not here for all the same reasons. But we\u2019re fighting the common fight. We\u2019re struggling all together.\u201d</p>, <p>While the pool of DACA applications is made mostly of youth from Latin American countries, Asian-Americans account for about <a href="http://cmsny.org/publications/reaching-undocumented-asian-americans-and-pacific-islanders-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank">11 percent</a> of those eligible for the immigration program. Within that group, fewer than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/05/us/politics/who-are-the-dreamers.html" target="_blank">30 percent of eligible Asian applicants apply.</a></p>, <p>Those able to apply before Tuesday\u2019s decision included undocumented minors who were brought to the U.S. before their 16th birthday and met another set of guidelines related to education and criminal background, among other requirements. In 2016, Asian countries \u2015 namely South Korea, China, India and the Philippines \u2015 were among the top 10 countries of origin for DACA-eligible populations.\xa0</p>, <p>Yet Asians don\u2019t speak out much about it.\xa0As an activist, Choi is attuned to the many reasons why. He pointed out there\u2019s a litany of factors.</p>, <p>\u201cAsian nonprofits might not be as good at outreach, even though there are organizations doing wonderful work,\u201d he said. \u201cResources are often not being pooled into Asian groups. We\u2019re isolated. We haven\u2019t come to terms with the fact that immigration is our issue.

Paul Ryan, Of Course!</h1>|[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON \u2015 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">President Donald Trump</a> made a bad deal for Republicans on the debt limit and government funding, and, according to House conservatives, that\u2019s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/paul-ryan">Speaker Paul Ryan</a>\u2019s fault.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What?</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A day after Trump surprised his own party by taking the first offer from congressional Democrats to raise the debt ceiling and continue government spending for three months, many House conservatives have decided that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) is ultimately to blame for Trump\u2019s impulsive deal.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cLack of preparation leads to poor choices, and the fact that we weren\u2019t here \u2015 and you heard me say this the other night \u2015 we weren\u2019t here for six weeks, the longest non-election-year break we\u2019ve had in a decade,\u201d former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Thursday, \u201cthat\u2019s a problem.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if Trump had effectively stepped in front of a bullet for Ryan by taking the blame for a bad deal that the speaker would have largely taken the responsibility for if the president had just stayed out of negotiations, Jordan said he wasn\u2019t here to blame anybody. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is we should have done what we had said back in July,\u201d Jordan answered. \u201cWe should have stayed here and put together a debt ceiling plan.\u201d</span></p>, <p>Obviously, Ryan has a lot of blame for a congressional recess, though the majority leader also has a say in the congressional schedule. But Jordan added that when lawmakers fail to prepare for deadlines, they don\u2019t have the best options come decision time.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That\u2019s not an unfair argument, but it ignores an obvious reality: This deal that Trump struck with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was a deal that Trump struck, not Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But time and again Thursday, conservatives ignored Trump\u2019s role in the agreement and found a way to blame the speaker.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think he saw the same-old, same-old kind of crap coming from leadership, and that wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) said of Trump, theorizing that the president was effectively preserving the debt limit issue until December.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as Gosar defended the president, he couldn\u2019t find an adequate reason to vote for the bill \u2015 he said he plans to oppose the package when it comes before the House \u2015 but Gosar noted he could see how this deal works to Trump\u2019s favor if the president plays his hand right.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That part seems unlikely. Lawmakers have repeatedly noted in the last two days that Trump just set a precedent that will be tough for him to break: He supported raising the debt ceiling without concessions, and he has agreed to fund the government without demanding money for his border wall.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Gosar acknowledged that Trump has made his negotiating position more difficult. \u201cHe may have lost that credibility,\u201d Gosar said. \u201cBut time will tell.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, conservatives generally refused to blame Trump for a deal that most of them believe to be bad for Republicans. Many said they couldn\u2019t answer questions until actually seeing the text of the deal. Many outright refused to answer questions. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about whether Donald Trump or Paul Ryan did a good or bad job,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And many others made tenuous connections between the deal and Paul Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI just see that the leadership team signed off on it and the rest of us find out about it,\u201d said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). King noted that Ryan and other GOP leaders didn\u2019t ever offer a conservative alternative to a clean increase in the debt ceiling \u2015 again, an argument that isn\u2019t wrong but somehow ignores the fact that Trump jumped at the chance for a clean debt limit.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) conveyed that he was disappointed in the deal. But even after he was presented with the argument that Ryan had called the Democratic offer \u201cridiculous\u201d Wednesday morning shortly before Trump took the offer, Gohmert said Ryan may actually have been a proponent of the deal. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he was or not,\u201d the congressman said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderates generally welcomed Trump\u2019s deal, noting that the president had effectively cut out the Freedom Caucus from negotiations. \u201cTo me, the main positive of this deal is we\u2019re not gonna have one group of 30 or 40 have veto power,\u201d Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow a group of 30 or 40 to be setting policy for the House of Representatives.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as much as moderates were celebrating the compromised position of conservatives, conservatives were muted in their criticism \u2015 at least of Trump, who many believe is the key to overthrowing Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservatives have quietly been laying the groundwork for a coup against Ryan, pointing out with increasing frequency that the speaker had no plan to extract GOP concessions on the debt ceiling or a continuing resolution. But it\u2019s difficult to argue that this legislation is really Ryan\u2019s fault when Trump got out in front of it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have spun Trump\u2019s decision as one recognizing that Democrats were going to win this negotiation, so better to just \u201cclear the decks\u201d and perhaps allow Congress to focus on tax reform. But even that explanation is fraught. The short-term nature of the deal ensures that lawmakers will be focused on negotiating a broader deal in December, not just cutting taxes.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan\u2019s own defense of the agreement is that Trump saw a nation recovering from one hurricane and preparing for another, and he wanted a bipartisan moment rather than a protracted disagreement. That argument may work for some, but Trump has put Republicans in a bind for future negotiations, and he did so with little to no consultation from congressional leaders or his legislative affairs staff, according to one senior GOP aide familiar with discussions.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if Trump himself wanted to preserve his conservative credentials and damage Paul Ryan, he just went ahead and did the exact opposite. The question is whether that will matter to the far-right lawmakers who already seem to be plotting Ryan\u2019s fall.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gosar was asked Thursday if he still supports Ryan as speaker, he repeatedly answered that he hadn\u2019t said \u201cone way or another.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if he would welcome Ryan campaigning for him, Gosar answered that he didn\u2019t have a challenger. Asked whether he would let Ryan even fundraise for him, Gosar said he didn\u2019t know about that, noting that Ryan was \u201cvery unpopular\u201d in his district.</span></p>]

Now They Must Prepare For Irma's Fury.</h1>|[<p>MIAMI \u2014 Ralph Henderson felt the foundation of his house shifting under his feet. It was the last week of August 1992, and Hurricane Andrew was pummeling South Florida with 165 mile per hour winds.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Andrew\u2019s winds and rains repeatedly slammed into his house, Henderson watched as his roof began to peel off. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then suddenly the wind died. The eye of the hurricane was passing over Henderson\u2019s home. When he went outside to survey the devastation, he had a hard time accepting what he saw. Across the road, a 24-foot moving truck was perched perfectly on the roof of what had been a U-Haul store. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt was up there for months because no one could get it down,\u201d Henderson, 52, told HuffPost.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Hurricane Irma, which has battered Caribbean islands with winds even stronger than Andrew\u2019s, appears to be coming to crush the Florida coast. Henderson knows exactly what to expect.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe know that pretty much everything is going to be destroyed,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThe trees are going to be gone, that fence is going to be gone. My boat might be gone. Anything left outside is going to be gone.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/20-facts-hurricane-andrew-anniversary_n_1819405.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed 44 Floridians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and caused an estimated $25 billion in damage across the state, where it flattened more than 25,000 homes and damaged at least 100,000 more. Few communities </span><a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/special-reports/hurricane-andrew/article168860937.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suffered worse than Country Walk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the storm destroyed up to 90 percent of its 1,700 homes. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the quaint town that sits about 25 miles southwest of Miami is home to 18,000 people \u2015 more than twice the number who lived there when Andrew hit. Concrete and stucco single-family homes with rust-colored clay tile roofs line the Country Walk area\u2019s leafy streets. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida\u2019s \u201c</span><a href="http://www.miamisao.com/publications/grand_jury/1990s/gj1992f4.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inadequate building codes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201d were responsible for the depth of Andrew\u2019s damage to areas like Country Walk, a Dade County grand jury report stated in the months after the storm. The same report also said a \u201clack of adequate preparation by our community and our state\u201d worsened the damage and noted that there was a \u201ctotal lack of coordination that existed between the various disaster relief agencies after the hurricane had passed. No one was in charge. No one knew what to do. There was no plan.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of that has changed in the quarter century since Andrew. Today, in the area of Country Walk that HuffPost visited, houses built after 1992 are required to have metal shutters for their windows, and Thursday afternoon, residents across the community labored in scorching heat and humidity to bolt the heavy covers in place.\xa0All around the neighborhood, the sounds of whirring drills and pounding hammers could be heard. Even with two or three people, it can take hours to bolt the hulking shutters in place, and their sharp edges pose their own dangers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Gov. Rick Scott has warned residents of his state that Irma is \u201cbigger, faster and stronger\u201d than Andrew, and mandatory evacuation orders have gone in effect for the most vulnerable areas (no such order is in effect yet for Country Walk). There is no apparent lack of coordination or preparation for Irma, at least in the days before the storm. </span></p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">I combined the images of Hurricane Andrew (1992) &amp; Hurricane Irma (today) at scale in a gif. Irma is a damn leviathan. <a href="https://t.co/4HEw1NNxxd">pic.twitter.com/4HEw1NNxxd</a></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even those preparations might not be enough.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cProbably my roof is going to be gone, [and] this house is going to be destroyed,\u201d Henderson said, pointing to a tall oak in his front yard that still stands slightly askew thanks to Hurricane Katrina, which briefly battered Florida before devastating the Gulf Coast. He is worried it will fall down this time, and knows the palm and olive trees along the street surely w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ill. \u201cThey\u2019ll all be gone,\u201d he said. \u201cSnatched up out of the ground.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin, a police officer who declined to give his last name, said he was in Homestead, Florida, during Andrew \u2014 another badly hit area. He, too, is preparing for Irma\u2019s absolute worst. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201c[Andrew] was nothing I\u2019d ever been through before and never cared to go through again,\u201d Kevin told HuffPost. \u201cBut here I am. It\u2019s different this time because I have a family.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He recalled staying at a friend\u2019s house during the storm two decades ago and the moment panic hit as debris crashed through the front sliding-glass doors only to shoot out the back sliding-glass doors. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cOnce the wind was in the house, that was it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went to every single room to try and save it. By the last room, my friend and I were holding the wall because the wall was breathing.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two dogs, a cat and 10 people huddled nervously inside. Pockets were left in the home where air-conditioning units had been \u201csucked out of the windows,\u201d but somehow the last room never buckled.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking up everything and evacuating the area isn\u2019t necessarily a simple solution. The cost alone has stopped many families from leaving. For Henderson, having pets makes the task even more difficult. And the storm is moving so quickly and is so large that residents feel as if they won\u2019t be able to outrun it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe have water, we have gas in the car, hopefully we have enough food,\u201d Juana Cubillas, 44, said from her home in Country Walk. \u201cWe put the shutters on, we just need to put the screws. We\u2019re almost done. It\u2019s not nice \u2015 the shutters are ugly and rusted \u2015 but it comes with the house and will help.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henderson recalled his own naivete when Andrew hit.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI would say, \u2019There\u2019s no way it can hit any harder,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then it would hit harder. And harder. And harder.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He expects Irma will be even worse.</span></p>]

The storm\u2019s trajectory is unpredictable, but they\u2019ve done everything they can to prepare: shopped for extra food, stocked up on medicines, and checked to make sure their independent living facility is equipped with a generator and hurricane-proof doors and windows. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But still, there\u2019s a lingering sense of vulnerability. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis one\u2019s scaring the hell out of me,\u201d Geisman said in a telephone interview on Friday. She dreads waiting out the next several days, and she\u2019s worried that if the electricity does fail, she\u2019ll have to navigate four floors of stairs with her walker. But Geisman, like many of the elderly residents who live in her building, feels like she doesn\u2019t have much of a choice. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe\u2019re all senior citizens, we have walkers, electric scooters, you know, we were all told to stay in our apartments. We have no place to go,\u201d Geisman said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 5.2 million residents over the age of 60, Florida\u2019s percentage of senior citizens ranks among the highest in the country. And many of Florida\u2019s elderly residents are concentrated near the southern coast, where Hurricane Irma is expected to make landfall over the weekend. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With winds forecasted to reach 150 miles per hour by the time it hits Florida, Hurricane Irma has already killed at least 20 people, destroying power lines and buildings as it rages through the Caribbean. It is expected to cause unprecedented levels of damage in Florida, a state that has already been hit by major hurricanes.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparing for a natural disaster of this scale presents a challenge for anyone \u2015 but senior citizens can face additional obstacles. They\u2019re more likely to deal with physical impairments that limit mobility, to require medical devices that require electricity, and to suffer from dementia, making it difficult to plan ahead or respond to a rapidly escalating situation.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2012 </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3711109/#R28"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that nursing home residents with dementia who were evacuated during a hurricane faced increased rates of hospitalization, morbidity and mortality in the months that followed. Even in non-disaster situations, traveling can disrupt an individual\u2019s sleeping and eating patterns \u2015 \u201call these changes are amplified when you have a highly chaotic situation,\u201d Lisa Brown, the study\u2019s lead author, explained in an interview. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida\u2019s care for its elderly community during natural disasters is the \u201cgold standard,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be struck with something like this, I think Florida nursing homes are really ahead of the curve.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nursing centers in Florida are required to have an emergency preparedness plan that is approved by local government officials responsible for emergency planning. The Florida Health Care Association, an advocacy group that represents 82 percent of the state\u2019s nursing centers, has been holding daily phone calls to brief facilities on the hurricane. The state has a reporting system that allows nursing facilities to share the number of beds they have available for evacuees. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guillermo Someillan, the owner My New Oasis, an assisted living facility in Miami, said he has two other facilities within driving distance that he and staff members can evacuate residents to if necessary. \u201cWe might have to get out and push tree limbs aside,\u201d to travel across the roads, he acknowledged. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someillan\u2019s main facility is just outside of the mandatory evacuation zone, so for now, he is focused on keeping his residents, some of whom have mild dementia, happy. He recently turned off the news and switched the televisions to show comedies instead. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to dwell on the worst-case scenario,\u201d he said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senior citizens who live on their own can be even more vulnerable during natural disasters than those in nursing homes or assisted living communities. People who want to evacuate but require assistance can register in advance with the <a href="https://snr.floridadisaster.org/Signin?ReturnUrl=%2f" target="_blank">Florida Special Needs Registry</a> \u2015 but they aren\u2019t guaranteed a spot, and not everyone who needs assistance knows how to access it. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida\u2019s Department of Elder Affairs has a list of people enrolled in state, local, or community programs for senior citizens. As of Thursday, staff members had finished calling everyone on the list, making sure they have what they need to get through the hurricane. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But several of the resource centers that provide transportation, food and medical services to the elderly have already closed, leaving senior citizens largely on their own for the next several days. For those who live in buildings without generators, electricity cuts would mean stifling heat and no elevator to get them downstairs. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Edith Lederberg, the executive director of the Aging and Disability Resource Center of Broward County, has spent the past several days arranging for seniors in the community to receive extra food deliveries from Meals on Wheels in preparation for the storm. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lederberg has worked at ADRC for more than 40 years, so she knows better than most the needs and concerns of the community. \u201cIt\u2019s a vulnerable population. People get very lonely and frightened,\u201d she said. </span></p>]

But she said on Friday that her bigger interest \u201clies with the young people whose futures are now being put in doubt and doing all we can to support and protect those young people.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are roughly 4,000 undocumented immigrants who attend schools in the University of California system, and Napolitano said on a call with reporters that a large proportion of them have DACA protections \u2015 so-called Dreamers. The state\u2019s university system also employs undocumented teachers, healthcare workers and other staff. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleges that Trump\u2019s </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decision to rescind the program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> violates the Administrative Procedure Act and constitutional due process, including that of students at University of California schools and the system itself. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe administration\u2019s approach in rescinding DACA was the opposite of reasoned decision-making and thus is unlawful,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cIt did not assess the costs of rescinding DACA to the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers or to the schools and communities in which they live, study and work.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit comes on the heels of a </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-against-trump-administration-daca_us_59b0453de4b0dfaafcf4fdd7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complaint by 15 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the District of Columbia and a challenge by a former recipient of the program. All are aiming to prevent Trump from ending DACA protections. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Napolitano\u2019s lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration illegally neglected to follow rules outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, which would have required more notice and a public comment period before making such a far-reaching change. Napolitano said that the situation was distinct from the creation of DACA, which did not go through a public comment period, because the program involved case-by-case determinations about prosecutorial discretion, while Trump\u2019s decision will hit recipients en masse. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u2033[Rescinding DACA] doesn\u2019t involve discretion at all,\u201d Napolitano said. \u201cIt says that for this whole category of cases the administration will not exercise discretion and will not defer deportations. So it deals with this population and a whole category, not individuals.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that DACA is also distinct from the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program, or DAPA, which was blocked in the courts because of a lawsuit that alleged, in part, that the Obama administration violated the Administrative Procedure Act in creating it. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday\u2019s lawsuit also argues that the Trump administration violated the due process rights of DACA recipients, which are protected by the Fifth Amendment, by \u201cexecutive fiat.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those arguments also form part of the two other legal challenges to the termination of DACA filed in New York shortly after the Trump administration announced it would phase out the signature immigration reform of the Obama years. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those cases was originally filed in Brooklyn last year by DACA recipient Mart\xedn Jonathan Batalla Vidal. He had challenged the revocation of his three-year work authorization after the program\u2019s expansion was blocked by a federal judge in Texas, along with a farther-reaching program to shield undocumented parents of U.S. citizens from deportation. Lawyers in the Batalla Vidal case requested to amend their lawsuit to challenge the termination of DACA within hours of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement on Tuesday. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition of 15 states and the District of Columbia, led by New York, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-against-trump-administration-daca_us_59b0453de4b0dfaafcf4fdd7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a second lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0on Wednesday aimed at keeping DACA alive. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of the New York lawsuits allege that Trump\u2019s decision to end DACA was motivated by an intent to discriminate against Mexicans, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-lawsuit-trump_us_59b05150e4b0354e440f053a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">citing the vitriolic statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at Mexican immigrants that he made repeatedly on the campaign trail. Napolitano\u2019s lawsuit does not include that claim. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic California Attorney General Xavier Becerra plans to file a fourth lawsuit in federal court in his home state disputing the decision to end DACA. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president has broad authority to undue the executive actions of previous administrations. But similar legal challenges largely blocked Trump\u2019s efforts to restrict virtually all visits from several Muslim-majority countries earlier this year. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether or not the lawsuits are ultimately successful, they open the possibility that one or more federal judges could issue an injunction that would halt the termination of DACA while the cases wind their way through the legal system. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has said he wants to work with Congress on a legislative solution for Dreamers in the six month window before many begin to lose their work permits and protections. Napolitano said she plans to continue to press members of Congress to solve the bill through law, even as she fights to maintain DACA in court. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI believe that in this case the court should act,\u201d Napolitano said, \u201cor in the alternative Congress should act and settle this matter for once and for all.\u201d</span></p>]

Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he author of an amendment to a spending bill that would cut funding to a respected Islamic international aid charity, was unexpectedly absent from the House floor on Thursday night, failing to offer the amendment for a vote.</span></p>, <p>The congressman told HuffPost he left Washington on Thursday ahead of the scheduled vote to prepare for Hurricane Irma, which is expected to impact his district on Florida\u2019s eastern coast in the coming days. But opponents of the amendment interpreted DeSantis\u2019 absence as a triumph of their coordinated efforts to defeat an amendment they said was motivated by Islamophobia.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://amendments-rules.house.gov/amendments/DESANT_056_xml824171640134013.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, tacked onto a consolidated appropriations bill, would have prohibited the State Department from funding for the nonprofit Islamic Relief Worldwide, a nonprofit organization that delivers emergency aid and development assistance around the world. The group\u2019s American affiliate, Islamic Relief USA (which would not have been impacted by the amendment), is currently providing assistance to Hurricane Harvey victims in Houston, Texas, and the surrounding areas.</span></p>, <p>DeSantis did not respond to a question about whether he would accept help from the group for victims of the the hurricane that is expected to hit Florida.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), one of two Muslim members of Congress, slammed the drafted amendment as a discriminatory effort to delegitimize a group that </span><a href="http://www.islamic-relief.org/about-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">describes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself as inspired by the Islamic faith. \u201cThis amendment singles out IRW for its religious affiliation. This is another attempt to criminalize and demonize organizations that are affiliated with the Muslim community,\u201d he wrote in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter that his office provided to HuffPost and circulated to all members of the House on Thursday ahead of the anticipated vote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly 50 of the world\u2019s most prominent humanitarian aid groups opposed DeSantis\u2019 amendment. The list of organizations, provided by Ellison\u2019s office, included Catholic Relief Services, CARE, Oxfam, HIAS, Mercy Corps, Church World Service, Refugees International, and InterAction, a coalition of almost 200 nonprofits in the U.S.<strong>\xa0</strong></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe are humbled by the strength and diversity of support we have been given by people who really know what we are about and the values we stand for,\u201d IRW said in a statement on Friday.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis told HuffPost he remains \u201ccommitted to blocking taxpayer funds for organizations with ties to terrorist groups such as Hamas.\u201d He did not present evidence for his allegation that the charity has ties to terrorism but appears to be referencing past unfounded accusations. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, Israel and the United Arab Emirates accused IRW of ties to terrorism. The group denied the allegations and\xa0</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/11/islamic-relief-charity-palestine-work-continues-israel"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched an internal investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and hired outside consultants to review its work. The audit produced no evidence to support the allegations, the group </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30443693"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time. More recently, the Center for Security Policy, a far-right think tank headed by Frank Gaffney, </span><a href="https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2015/06/08/charity-islamic-relief-usa-strong-ties-to-terrorism-and-us-refugees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> IRW of working with the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ellison, the IRW has been audited over 500 times. \u201cNone of the allegations have been demonstrated,\u201d Ellison wrote in the letter to his House colleagues.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis\u2019 amendment, Ellison said, would effectively punish the charity without first proving guilt. \u201cBecause the audits and courts could not find IRW guilty of wrongdoing, Rep. DeSantis wants us to find IRW guilty via legislative means, and punish them for it. This is a bill of attainder and is unconstitutional,\u201d Ellison wrote.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If DeSantis had brought the amendment to the floor, he would have forced Republicans to take a difficult vote on a measure criticized as Islamophobic at a time when some members of the party are trying to distance themselves from President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s anti-Islam rhetoric.\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/></span></p>, <p>AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who yields some control over which amendments receive a vote, referred HuffPost to the House Rules Committee when asked about Ryan\u2019s position on pulling funds from the group. Committee spokeswoman Caroline Boothe would not say whether the Rules Committee opposed the amendment.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in the United Kingdom, IRW has worked in over 30 countries, according to the group\u2019s website. The group has United Nations consultative status, takes part in the United Kingdom Disasters Emergency Committee, and works with prominent aid organizations like Catholic Relief Services, World Vision, and the Red Cross, Ellison noted in the letter. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the U.S., the IRW currently receives funding from the World Food Programme, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNICEF, UN Women, the European Community Humanitarian Office, the governments of Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The U.S. government has not placed any restrictions or designations on the group. Islamic Relief-USA is one of several organizations included in the federal government\u2019s workplace charitable giving program. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that IRW could receive such broad support if it funded or had links to terrorism,\u201d Ellison wrote. </span></p>]

After that, unless they proactively cancel, they may have to pay. The <a href="https://www.trustedid.com/premier/terms-of-use.php" target="_blank">terms of use</a>\xa0say customers must have internet access and a credit or debit card to sign up.</p>, <p>\u201cWe will not bill You until the free trial period has expired and provided that You have not yet cancelled your trial membership,\u201d say the terms, dated Sept. 6. \u201cIn the event that You wish to continue Your membership beyond the trial period, do nothing and Your membership will automatically continue without interruption and We will begin billing You via the payment source You provided when you signed up for the free trial.\u201d</p>, <p>Robert Weissman, president of the consumer watchdog Public Citizen, said, \u201cIt appears that the company thinks one of the worst data breaches in history is a marketing opportunity. Instead of trying to rip people off with new hidden charges and trick consumers to give up their rights it might be a better idea to actually remedy the harm.\u201d</p>, <p>A spokesperson for Equifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the free service.</p>, <p>Customers also must agree to settle disputes outside of court in an extremely business-friendly format known as arbitration.</p>, <p>Consumer advocates describe the arbitration clause as a straightforward ripoff for the 143 million Americans whose Social Security numbers and addresses are now in the hands of criminals thanks to a breach earlier this year. Though it discovered the breach in late July, Equifax publicly\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/equifax-says-hack-potentially-exposed-details-of-143-million-consumers_us_59b1bc2de4b0354e4410b33e" target="_blank">announced</a>\xa0the news on Thursday.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cAt this point it\u2019s very clear that Equifax is trying to use this massive data breach as an excuse to profit, which is just appalling behavior,\u201d said Amanda Werner, the campaign manager at Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cI can\u2019t even put into words how awful this behavior is.\u201d</p>, <p>As Equifax explains in the terms of use, customers using its products are subject to mandatory, binding arbitration. \u201cBy consenting to submit Your Claims to arbitration, You will be forfeiting Your right to bring or participate in any class action (whether as a named plaintiff or a class member) or to share in any class action awards, including class claims where a class has not yet been certified, even if the facts and circumstances upon which the Claims are based already occurred or existed.\u201d</p>, <p>Weissman said that the arbitration clause attached to the free credit monitoring service covers only the credit monitoring service offered and not the overarching breach of data. Still, if Equifax failed to inform a customer \u2015 a victim of the hack, say \u2015 that their identity had been compromised and was being used without their knowledge, by signing up for their free credit monitoring offer and thus agreeing to the arbitration clause, they would have waived the right to sue over this failure outside of arbitration.</p>, <p>However, Equifax also requires consumers who have requested their credit score directly from the company in the past to have agreed to an arbitration clause that could cover the breach.</p>, <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve been an Equifax customer, they will claim that you have agreed to an arbitration provision,\u201d Weissman said.</p>, <p>A company spokesman said the arbitration only applied to the free credit monitoring, not the cybersecurity breach.</p>, <p>Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, are the three largest companies that track credit histories of everybody who takes out a loan or signs up a credit card, creating proprietary \u201cscores\u201d that help lenders evaluate a potential borrower\u2019s ability to pay.</p>, <p>The companies are notorious for charging access for the information, which by law is available to consumers for free once a year. Experian has been <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/05/free-credit-report-how-th_n_172190.html" target="_blank">fined multiple times</a> by the Federal Trade Commission for tricking consumers with false promises of \u201cfree\u201d credit reports that wound up costing money.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies often require consumers to use their products or services if they waive their right to pursue class action lawsuits and enter into direct arbitration with the business if they seek a legal redress to a wrong. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Equifax, everyone who signs up for the free credit monitoring the company is offering to the 143 million people whose data has been compromised is waiving their right to join in a class action suit if something goes wrong with the credit monitoring. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insertion of arbitration clauses into dense terms of service contracts that consumers rarely read has exploded in the past six years. In 2011, the Supreme Court upheld a forced arbitration provision inserted into AT&amp;T contracts in a divided 5-4 ruling. This was one of many tightly divided decisions in recent years where the conservative majority on the court </span><a href="http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaug-2014/thrown-out-of-court/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled in favor of corporate rights to force consumers into arbitration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the face of the corporate tilt of the Supreme Court, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the financial watchdog agency created by the 2010 Wall Street reform legislation, recently <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/arbitration-rule/" target="_blank">announced a new rule against mandatory arbitration clauses</a> disallowing class action lawsuits. But Republicans in Congress have vowed to strike the rule.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new CFPB arbitration rule is scheduled to take effect on Sept.\xa018. House Republicans, however, already passed a resolution in July that would block the implementation of the rule. Republicans in the Senate have introduced similar legislation, but have not yet voted on it. That legislation is not subject to a filibuster and would therefore only require 50 votes to pass in a chamber with 52 Republican senators.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, congressional Republicans are pushing legislation introduced by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) that sides with the credit reporting companies. Loudermilk\u2019s bill would place a $500,000 cap on punitive damages for consumers who have been wronged. In an ironic twist, the House Financial Services Committee </span><a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=402266" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held a hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Loudermilk\u2019s bill on Thursday \u2015 the same day Equifax revealed the breach of consumer data.</span></p>]

And unfortunately, that did not occur,\u201d Ramirez-Rosa told HuffPost. \u201cMy hope is that five years from now, as a Democratic Party, we are more committed to having these constructive dialogues and allowing for these differences to exist.\u201d</p>, <p>Biss\u2019s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/09/01/illinois-democrat-picks-democratic-socialist-as-running-mate-for-gubernatorial-run/">selection of Ramirez-Rosa</a> as his candidate for lieutenant governor last Thursday sparked an outpouring of excitement from progressive activists and organizations. At 28, Ramirez-Rosa is Chicago\u2019s first openly gay Latino alderman and one of the country\u2019s most prominent members of the Democratic Socialists of America. Thanks in no small part to Sanders, who calls himself a democratic socialist, DSA has seen its dues-paying membership nearly quadruple, to more than 28,000, since the November election. Ramirez-Rosa, who joined in February, has become the organization\u2019s closest thing to a political celebrity.</p>, <p>But Ramirez-Rosa\u2019s affiliation with DSA, which has endorsed the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, immediately created a political headache for Biss.</p>, <p>Ramirez-Rosa, who served as a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/democratic-convention/">Democratic National Convention</a> delegate for Sanders in July 2016, has also spoken out against what he considers the United States\u2019 sponsorship of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories Israel conquered in 1967.</p>, <p>\u201cYou know, for too long the U.S. government has subsidized the oppression of the Palestinian people, and it\u2019s time that that\u2019s stopped,\u201d Ramirez-Rosa told the left-wing <a href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=16615">Real News Network in June 2016</a>. \u201cAnd we have seen a shift internationally in favor of justice for the Palestinian people. You know, people stand with Israel, but they also want to make sure the Palestinian people have [justice].\u201d</p>, <p>Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), a moderate who represents affluent Chicago suburbs, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/schneiderforcongress/posts/1738431632897634">withdrew his endorsement of Biss</a> in a note on Facebook on Sunday, citing Ramirez-Rosa\u2019s tough criticism of Israel and membership in DSA. Schneider is an <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/campaign/276519-playing-politics-with-israel-and-iran-in-illinois">active member</a> of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a hawkish and influential pro-Israel lobby, and pro-Israel groups were his <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/industries?cycle=2016&amp;id=IL10&amp;spec=N">third-largest category of donors</a> in 2016.</p>, <p>Biss responded by demanding that Ramirez-Rosa unequivocally denounce BDS or leave the ticket, according to a source with knowledge of their conversations.</p>, <p>After several days of discussions, Ramirez-Rosa announced his departure from the ticket, claiming in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/carlosforchicago/posts/815120678659094">Facebook message</a> that his difference of opinion with Biss on BDS at the federal rather than state level had proved insurmountable. (In an interview with HuffPost, Ramirez-Rosa would not confirm the details of their talks, citing his commitment to their shared privacy.)</p>, <p>Ramirez-Rosa said he refuses to condemn BDS in all its forms because he believes that it is \u201cpart of a constructive dialogue\u201d about how the United States should leverage its power on the global stage to end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to throw a nonviolent movement under the bus or impugn their aims or impugn their tactics,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cAmongst the international community and within the United States, there is a broad agreement that we need to end the occupation of Palestine, that we need a solution that recognizes the humanity of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people.\u201d</p>, <p>Such a solution must also recognize \u201c4,000 years of anti-Semitism,\u201d he added.</p>, <p>At the same time, Ramirez-Rosa does not support state governments boycotting Israel, since foreign policy is a federal matter.</p>, <p>When asked by HuffPost if, in his capacity as lieutenant governor, he would have visited Israel as part of a state government delegation,\xa0Ramirez-Rosa affirmed that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would have.</p>, <p>Ramirez-Rosa said he remained supportive of a two-state solution in which a Palestinian state would exist alongside Israel. He has not adopted the far left\u2019s preference for the creation of one binational state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.</p>, <p>Biss, who is Jewish and whose mother is Israeli, said in a statement about <a href="https://www.danielbiss.com/lg-announcement/">Ramirez-Rosa\u2019s departure</a>\xa0that he believes BDS \u201cmoves us further away from a peaceful solution.\u201d</p>, <p>He also accused Ramirez-Rosa of failing to be upfront about his views on the matter.</p>, <p>\u201cWhen I asked him in the interview process prior to his selection, Carlos said he too supported a two-state solution and opposed BDS,\u201d Biss wrote. \u201cAfter much discussion, it\u2019s become clear that Carlos\u2019 position has changed. While I respect his right to come to his own conclusions on the issue, it simply wasn\u2019t the understanding we shared when I asked him to join the ticket.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramirez-Rosa insisted to HuffPost that he spoke candidly about it, explaining his opposition to boycotts by state governments and openness to federally led boycotts. When pressed, he acknowledged that the distinction between state-government and federal-government boycotts may have led Biss to misunderstand.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to find \u200bRosa\u2019s positions on this issue,\u201d said Micah Uetricht, a friend of Ramirez-Rosa\u2019s and associate editor of Jacobin, a popular socialist magazine. \u201cIf you Googled \u2018Carlos Rosa Israel Palestine\u2019 you could find his position on it. Did no one in the Biss campaign do this?\u200b\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BDS </span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/call"><span style="font-weight: 400;">began in 2005</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when Palestinian civil society groups asked the international community to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel </span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">until Israel ends its occupation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Palestinian territories captured in 1967, allows Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war to return to their homes and grants equal rights to Israel\u2019s Palestinian citizens.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The movement has steadily picked up adherents, particularly in Europe, with many European musicians, including Roger Waters and Brian Eno,\xa0</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/15/israel.booksnews"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refusing to tour in Israel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BDS remains relatively obscure and controversial in the United States, however, where public opinion is more supportive of the Israeli government. </span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents of BDS argue that it unfairly singles out Israel among all of the world\u2019s many imperfect nations. Critics also object to its leaders\u2019 insistence on a right of return for all Palestinian refugees, which would dissolve the demographic Jewish majority that is the basis for Israel\u2019s \u201cJewish character.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramirez-Rosa admitted that he is not familiar with the finer details of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, including the best way to address the issue of Palestinian refugees.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the near term, the biggest casualty of Biss\u2019s rupture with Ramirez-Rosa appears to have been his own campaign.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are clamoring to unseat Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner, a billionaire Republican viewed as one of 2018\u2019s more vulnerable incumbents. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a crowded and contentious field dominated by billionaire investor J.B. Pritzker and philanthropist Chris Kennedy, son of the late Robert F. Kennedy,\xa0Biss is seeking to upset his well-heeled competitors by cornering the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. He boasts an\xa0<a href="https://www.danielbiss.com/issue/the-economy/#protecting-workers-increasing-wages" target="_blank">ambitious platform</a>\xa0that calls for a $15 minimum wage, state-level single-payer health care, paid family leave and free public college tuition.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Biss\u2019s lack of a running mate limits his ability to collect the petition signatures he needs to land a spot on the ballot, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/09/07/in-illinois-a-democrat-chooses-a-socialist-running-mate-then-dumps-him/?utm_term=.1b26b7ee0c50" target="_blank">according to The Washington Post\u2019s Dave Weigel</a>. And his rejection of Ramirez-Rosa has <a href="https://medium.com/@ourrevolutionil/statement-from-our-revolution-illinois-chicago-on-biss-campaign-lt-f823738666e5" target="_blank">prompted criticism</a> from previously supportive individuals and groups, souring much of the credibility he\u2019d earned with progressive activists. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biss \u201cjust seems like an empty suit,\u201d Uetricht said. \u201cHe saw a political opportunity in the Bernie Sanders campaign, a political moment where if you embraced Bernie-style politics you could get somewhere, but that was a purely opportunistic move.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Ramirez-Rosa would no longer commit to voting for Biss.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI will be playing close attention to how this race unfolds,\u201d he said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biss\u2019s fall from grace may open up room for Chicago Alderman <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/08/11/illinois-democrat-says-elect-him-governor-and-hell-commute-all-low-level-drug-sentences/" target="_blank">Ameya Pawar</a>, another long-shot contender who has also sought to court left-leaning voters.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramirez-Rosa\u2019s progressive allies see his decision not to renounce BDS as a foreshadowing of the growing acceptance of BDS and a long-term win for the democratic socialists who embrace it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis country is dramatically changing and things that used to seem impossible are very much probable,\u201d said David Duhalde, the deputy director of the Democratic Socialists of America. \xa0</span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carlos\u2019 decision \u201cshows people how incredibly committed and principled politicians like Carlos are and Democratic Socialists of America members are, too,\u201d Duhalde added. \u201cPeople like Carlos sticking by their values is a very good thing for the socialist movement.\u201d</span></p>]

The data shows that 6,540\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">people in the state used same-day voter registration with an out-of-state drivers license. New Hampshire gives new residents 60 days to get a driver\u2019s license, but by the end of August 2017, the data showed, 5,313 of those people had not obtained a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license or register a vehicle in the state.</span></p>, <p>Kobach, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-voter-fraud-commission_us_5915e3cce4b0031e737d5d9c">who has a history of exaggerating voter fraud</a>, said the data signaled there was \u201cproof\u201d illegal votes could have swung the election in New Hampshire, noting that Hillary Clinton defeated Trump by 2,732 votes in the state and Sen. Maggie Hassan (D) defeated former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) by just over 1,000 votes.</p>, <p>His claim about voter fraud in New Hampshire comes just days before the commission is scheduled to meet there next week.</p>, <p>J. Christian Adams, another member of the committee,\xa0<a href="https://pjmedia.com/jchristianadams/2017/09/07/new-data-illegal-voters-may-decided-new-hampshire-2016/" target="_blank">also seized</a> on the data as evidence of widespread voter fraud. Marc Lotter, a spokesman for Vice President Mike Pence, the commission\u2019s chair,\xa0<a href="https://twitter.com/VPPressSec/status/905874189613137924" target="_blank">also tweeted </a>a link to a story with the information.</p>, <p>\u201cIf the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result,\u201d Kobach wrote in his article.</p>, <p>But Kobach\u2019s claim of fraud is flagrantly misleading. New Hampshire sets different qualifications for people to vote and to get a driver\u2019s license. Under state law, not everyone who is qualified to vote is qualified to get a driver\u2019s license.\xa0</p>, <p>To register to vote in New Hampshire, someone only needs to be \u201cdomiciled\u201d there, meaning they currently live in the state and intend stay there for a definite period of time.</p>, <p>The definition allows people like college students, doctors completing their residency and military personnel who are stationed in the state to vote, Gilles Bissonnette, the legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire said in an email.</p>, <p>To get a driver\u2019s license, however, a person must be categorized as a \u201cresident.\u201d According to the state,\xa0people are \u201cresidents\u201d if they plan to remain in the state for an indefinite period of time.</p>, <p>The Washington Post contacted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/09/08/election-integrity-commission-members-accuse-new-hampshire-voters-of-fraud/?utm_term=.8feb3dd5ff12" target="_blank">four college students</a> in New Hampshire who had legally voted with out of state identification.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Hampshire Supreme Court </span><a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/new-hampshire/supreme-court/2015/2014-055.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spelled out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the differences between a <br/>\u201cdomicile\u201d and a \u201cresident\u201d in a 2015 decision.</span></p>, <p>\u201cUpon becoming a \u2018resident\u2019 of New Hampshire, one has 60 days in which to register one\u2019s vehicle here and to obtain a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license. These requirements do not apply to citizens who are not \u2018residents\u2019 of New Hampshire, although they have their \u2018domicile\u2019 here.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The places with the highest rates of out-of-state IDs during same day registration were college campuses, </span><a href="http://nhpr.org/post/where-were-out-state-ids-used-vote-new-hampshire-last-november#stream/0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to New Hampshire Public Radio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p>Since Trump created the commission in May, critics have long voiced alarm that it would seek to find voter fraud where it doesn\u2019t exist. Several studies have shown it <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/debunking-voter-fraud-myth" target="_blank">is not a widespread problem</a>.\xa0Kobach\u2019s Thursday op-ed provides a clear example of his attempts to distort statistics and to disregard non-permanent residents to make it seem like a pervasive problem exists. The commission has repeatedly pledged to be neutral.</p>, <p>Earlier this year, Trump said he would have won New Hampshire\u2019s electoral votes had it not been for illegal voters <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-voter-fraud_us_589e21e7e4b0ab2d2b151e51">who were bused</a> into the state to vote. New Hampshire election officials have said they have no evidence to support that claim and Trump hasn\u2019t offered any. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner (D), who is also a member of Trump\u2019s voter fraud probe, <a href="http://nhpr.org/post/data-out-state-ids-fuels-cries-fraud-2016-election#stream/0" target="_blank">told New Hampshire Public Radio</a> he still didn\u2019t have any evidence to question the outcome of the election in November. Still, earlier this year, the state passed a law <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-voter-fraud_us_59677288e4b0a0c6f1e64a89">tightening the requirements</a> for proof residents have to present when they go to register to vote</p>, <p>Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap (D), another member of the commission, said he had not yet read Kobach\u2019s op-ed, but disputed his claim.</p>, <p>\u201cI categorically disagree that not updating your driver\u2019s license is proof of voter fraud,\u201d he said in an interview.</p>, <p>Kobach recently revealed he is getting paid to write columns for Breitbart. Ethics experts have said it could run afoul of federal <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-breitbart-ethics_us_59b13f04e4b0b5e531040fe2">conflict of interest law</a> for him to write about the commission\u2019s work.<br/><br/></p>]

The 2005 video of Trump, then a reality TV star, famously showed him bragging on a hot mike to Access Hollywood host Billy Bush that his stardom allowed him to \u201cgrab [women]\xa0by the pussy.\u201d</p>, <p>Christie failed that test, according to Bannon,\xa0when he didn\u2019t show up for a flight on the campaign jet the weekend after the scandal broke.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m Irish. I gotta get my black book and I got \u2019em,\u201d Bannon told Rose in an excerpt of the interview that aired on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d on Friday. \u201cChristie, because of Billy Bush weekend ... was not looked at for a cabinet position.\u201d</p>, <p>Bannon also lost confidence in Reince Priebus, the then-chairman of the Republican National Committee who went on to become Trump\u2019s chief of staff, over his reaction to the tape.</p>, <p>In a room full of advisers consulting Trump on how to respond to the controversial leak, Priebus told Trump he faced a choice between dropping out and losing by \u201cthe biggest landslide in American history,\u201d according to Bannon.</p>, <p>Bannon, however, insisted that Trump still had a \u201c100 percent probability of winning.\u201d</p>, <p>He bet that Trump\u2019s working-class base would not care about the tape, because it was \u201clocker room talk.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIt was a winner.

But what makes this vote significant is that only 90 Republicans can now say they don\u2019t support clean raises of the debt ceiling. That a bill this bad for the GOP got this many votes is a testament to Republicans still not wanting to cross Trump \u2015 and the vote total probably would have looked even more overwhelming had more members been present.</p>, <p>Due in large part to Florida lawmakers wanting to be in their districts before <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/irma-turks-caicos-bahamas_us_59b17f17e4b0dfaafcf63a78?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009">Hurricane Irma</a> hits, there were more absences in the House than usual.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message from this vote, however, was clear: Republicans, by and large, will vote with Trump even when it goes against years of GOP rhetoric on fiscal responsibility.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal, at first glance, isn\u2019t a big one. Government funding is extended for three months, and the debt ceiling is raised until December, at which point Treasury could once again use \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to keep making payments without raising the debt limit.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the agreement sets up a spending showdown in early December, when lawmakers will once again have to act to avert a shutdown. Bigger than what the agreement worked out between Trump, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) actually does, however, is the precedent it sets. Trump and Republicans are willing to fund the government without a border wall, and they will raise the debt ceiling without any sort of spending reforms. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is a big victory for Democrats in Washington, and that is why Republican opposition to this Harvey aid bill ballooned after the Senate amended the legislation to include a continuing resolution and a debt ceiling increase. (Earlier this week, the House approved a roughly $8 billion package for Harvey victims by a vote of </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/06/house-has-the-votes-to-approve-nearly-8-billion-for-harvey-aid-as-voting-continues.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">419-3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the three \u201cno\u201d votes coming from Republicans who wanted to see spending offsets for the aid, and then the Senate passed the amended bill </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/07/senate-has-the-votes-to-approve-trump-democrats-deal-on-harvey-aid-debt-funding.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80-17</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Thursday, attaching the CR and debt ceiling provisions at the behest of Trump and adding another $7 billion in community redevelopment funds.)</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, even with the new provisions, 133 Republicans joined 183 Democrats to approve the bill.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as raw of a deal as it was for Republicans who wanted to see some reforms on spending, there was some political peril in opposing the revised legislation. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Harvey aid provisions are popular with voters, and Democratic strategists believe a number of Republicans who could have tough races in 2018 \u2015 like Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) and Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) \u2015 made a mistake by opposing the bill.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cVulnerable House Republicans voting against relief for American families still reeling from Hurricane Harvey would be reckless and cruel on its own, but the fact that it was also a vote for a government shutdown and defaulting on America\u2019s debt gives new meaning to the word irresponsible,\u201d Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Tyler Law told HuffPost. \u201cIf you want to understand why Americans are disgusted by Republicans in Congress, look no further than this vote.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One constituency that did get behind the bill was Texas Republicans.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-harvey-texas-republicans-sandy-hypocrisy_us_59a46fcce4b041393a1fc43a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23 out of 24 Texas Republicans voted against aid for Hurricane Sandy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing unrelated spending provisions they didn\u2019t like, only four Texas Republicans voted against aid for Harvey: Joe Barton, Jeb Hensarling, Sam Johnson and Mac Thornberry.</span></p>, <p>You can take a look at every member who voted for and against the bill <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll480.xml" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill now goes to the president\u2019s desk for his signature.</span></p>]

El Paso is also a blue island in a blood red state \u2015 nearly 70 percent of the city voted for Hillary Clinton \u2015 but the same is true for Austin, the beloved state capitol.</p>, <p>It seems more likely that El Paso\u2019s public image problem has to do with its role as a junction, one that joins the U.S. to Mexico. At a time when President Donald Trump is campaigning to build a wall between the two nations, El Paso is a bridge.</p>, <p>Veronica Escobar wants to be the woman to change people\u2019s perceptions of El Paso, and the border more broadly.\xa0The gregarious, irreverent 47-year-old Mexican-American announced in late August that she is running in the Democratic primary to replace U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s (D-Texas) as he vacates the seat to challenge Republican Ted Cruz for Senate. If successful, she would be the first Latina Texas has ever elected to Congress \u2015 a surprising milestone, given that the state is 40 percent Latino. \xa0\xa0</p>, <p>But Escobar is more interested in being a voice for El Paso and immigrant rights than breaking a glass ceiling.</p>, <p>\u201cEl Paso is in my blood; it\u2019s in my DNA,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cI love our geography in the middle of the desert, that we\u2019re isolated from other areas and having to make do. I love our position on the U.S.-Mexico border. I love that we\u2019ve always been the underdog. I just love this community so much that even without Donald Trump, I\u2019m inspired by El Paso.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he Friday night before announcing her run for Congress, Escobar gathered with a half-dozen of her campaign volunteers in the empty lobby of an artful terra-cotta low-rise building in downtown El Paso, Texas. She\u2019d brought together a diverse cadre of supporters, including a young gay couple whose wedding she officiated and the 27-year-old high school civics teacher who taught her her son and daughter.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Escobar\u2019s campaign manager was trying to give the team a rehearsal for the event the next day, but the candidate was too excited to take the moment seriously. She joked that the plan was to slowly lower her into the crowd from the building\u2019s skylight atrium in a puff of confetti, and then dramatically unfurl a banner from the second-story balcony with her name on it. \u201cThe technical term is big ass banner,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all do some tequila shots before.\u201d</span></p>, <p>Escobar wanted to\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">announce her campaign in a central building downtown because she has worked hard to revitalize the neighborhood since being elected El Paso county judge in 2010 \u2015 an administrative leadership position that oversees that county\u2019s budget. The once-bustling border town was largely deserted in the mid-1990s as unemployment soared after the enactment of the </span>North American Free Trade Agreement. B<span style="font-weight: 400;">ut the town has since witnessed a rebirth as officials trained workers to take advantage of their location as a trade hub and move into higher-wage jobs, where they have been\xa0</span><a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/swe/2016/swe1604g.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adapting and transforming the city\u2019s economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Escobar\u2019s leadership for the past eight years, downtown El Paso has flourished and now boasts green parks with fountains and sculptures, bustling bars, theaters, hipster music venues and a famous pawn shop that claims to have Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa\u2019s trigger finger on sale for $9,500. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt was really important to me that we launch downtown,\u201d she told her volunteers the night before the launch. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen such an evolution downtown \u2015 a decline, and a renaissance now, and this is the center of it.\u201d</span></p>, <p>After meeting with her team, Escobar brought them to the patio of her favorite bar downtown, overlooking the Franklin mountains, for cocktails and nachos. Her whole family joined, including her 20-year-old son, a sophomore at Harvard; her 18-year-old daughter, a rising freshman at Simmons College; her husband, a federal immigration judge (confirmed, ironically, by Trump); and her brother, a foreign service officer who flew into town from Washington, D.C., for her announcement the next day. Nearly everyone who walked into or out of the bar squealed and waved when they spotted her at a table. \u201cTomorrow!\u201d Escobar shouted back to each one. \u201cBe there or be square!\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Escobar is blissfully happy in El Paso. Having inherited a passion for Mexican cooking from her mother, her favorite thing to do after coming home from work is to pick apples from the tree in her front yard and make calabacitas, enchiladas,\xa0and apple pies for her daughter and son, whom she addresses as \u201cmi amor.\u201d \xa0\u201cIf my kids were smaller, I wouldn\u2019t have even considered this,\u201d she says. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of commuting to Washington, D.C., every week from her remote town does not appeal to Escobar at all. But Donald Trump and his rhetoric about immigrants and the border have terrified her and inspired her to run. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cHe really frightens me and in a way that I haven\u2019t been frightened before,\u201d she says. \u201cI worry about the planet. I worry about immigrants. I worry about women. I worry about the LGBT community. I worry about the El Paso and the border. And I feel this very intense sense of dread.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the table, a campaign volunteer interrupts Escobar to read her a news alert from his smartphone: Trump has just pardoned ex-sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted in July of violating a federal court order to stop racially profiling Latinos in Arizona. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cUn-fucking-believable,\u201d Escobar seethes, before remembering that she is sitting next to a reporter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but do you know what message that sends to Hispanics? \u2018You don\u2019t belong here.\u2019\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being a public servant for more than a decade, Escobar said she never pictured herself running for Congress before Trump became president. Her friends describe her as the \u201csalt-of-the-earth.\u201d She grew up working on a dairy farm in El Paso, washing milk and manure out of her four brothers\u2019 jeans. She left to obtain a Master\u2019s Degree in English Literature at New York University, and then returned in 1993 to teach Chicano literature at the University of Texas at El Paso. </span></p>, <p>Upon returning home, she noticed some \u201cdisturbing\u201d xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment in her largely Mexican-American community that has close ties to Ju\xe1rez \u2015 there was talk, for the first time, of a wall being built on the border. She decided to join advocacy efforts for the Border Rights Coalition (now the Border Network for Human Rights) in addition to her job at the school. \u201cI just remember thinking, \u2018I have to get involved, this not who we are. We\u2019re this great bi-national community. What happened?\u2019\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Escobar eventually became co-chair of the coalition, and her passion for public service grew from there. During her time as county judge,\xa0she and the four other members of the commissioners court fought to build El Paso\u2019s first children\u2019s hospital, extended health care benefits to the domestic partners of LGBT city and county employees, and passed a resolution denouncing Texas\u2019 \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which would prevent transgender students from using the bathroom of their choice. One year short of her full term, Escobar resigned from her position in August to run for Congress.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is far from an elite politician. The night before her campaign event, one of her volunteers asked her what took her so long to jump into the Democratic primary race, since her opponent, Republican-turned-Democrat Dori Fenenbock, has been fundraising for months. Escobar replied that she and her husband, federal immigration judge Michael Pleters, needed to get their finances in order before she went jobless for a year. \u201cI had to buy a lot of tortillas and beans and freeze them,\u201d she said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because El Paso is a solidly blue district, Escobar won\u2019t face any significant challenge from a Republican. Her main challenge is that she is behind on fundraising in the primary \u2015 Fenenbock, former president of the El Paso Independent School District board, had already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars before Escobar entered the race. But nearly </span><a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2017/07/17/top-donors-dori-fenenbocks-congressional-campaign/484600001/?cookies=&amp;from=global"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half of that money came from Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which might not play well in the progressive district. And El Paso\u2019s popular former congressman, O\u2019Rourke, is publicly backing Escobar, which gives her a major advantage in the race. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Escobar\u2019s candidacy has been highly anticipated by the Latino community. A long list of Latino celebrities and politicians, including U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tx.) and actresses Eva Longoria and Grace Parra, have been urging Escobar to run through the Latino Victory Fund\u2019s \u201cRun Veronica Run\u201d campaign. Escobar is \u201cfloored\u201d by the attention, but mostly thrilled that the race is putting El Paso on the map. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe fact that there\u2019s so much interest in our community and so many eyes on us right now, it is incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, it was an opportunity for El Paso to be in the limelight.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Escobar could have a bright future in the Democratic party. Beyond border issues, she considers herself a Bernie Sanders-style progressive, favoring single-payer health care and free college tuition for those who want a degree. She strongly supports abortion rights, despite the issue\u2019s controversy in the deeply Catholic Latino community. And she believes that Trump was elected in part because the Democratic Party focused too much on identity politics and not enough on the fact that the American middle class is \u201cshrinking and calling out for help.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s really not necessarily just about minorities being left out, it\u2019s more about an entire class of Americans being left out, many of whom are white and who feel like they don\u2019t have access to great jobs and great education, and the jobs they could do and were comfortable doing are gone,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of them feel like Democrats are only about pushing minority rights. Here I am, the person who could break a barrier for Texas \u2015 and I believe diversity is critical, and I am very proud that I have the opportunity to blaze that trail for other Latinas behind me \u2015 but as a party, we have to recognize that there are white Americans in the middle class that have been left out. And I think Bernie did that.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Escobar channeled Sanders\u2019 spirit and brio as she announced her candidacy on a sunny Saturday afternoon in downtown El Paso. Roughly 300 El Pasoans packed into the lobby of the 7-story, mixed-use building to see her speak. Noting the presence of her 72-year-old immigrant mother in the crowd, Escobar delivered a passionate 20-minute speech about her pride for El Paso, her support for universal health care and education, her plans to be a voice for the U.S.-Mexico border, and yes, that glass ceiling. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But her biggest cheers came when she condemned Trump\u2019s treatment of Hispanics. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWhen you have a president who pardons someone who believes racial profiling should be the M.O. in an entire state, it\u2019s time to stand up,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is sending Latino communities a very clear message with that pardon, and that message is that we don\u2019t matter and that our civil rights and our constitutional rights don\u2019t matter. You know what? They matter to us.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Latinos in the crowd were visibly emotional as Escobar spoke. Christina Sanchez, 38, burst into tears when asked whether it was important to her that Escobar break that barrier for Hispanic women.</span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt means a lot, especially now with what you near from the national level,\u201d she said. \u201cTo really be that first Latina from Texas\u2026 it\u2019s important for me, it\u2019s important for my family, and it\u2019s important for my daughter to see a person who\u2019s like her in that role.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Escobar ended her speech to the Beatles\u2019 song \u201cRevolution.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s just a fantastic song, and we need a revolution,\u201d she said after the event. \u201cI want people to feel like they have a stake in creating change, and we\u2019re arming ourselves with good vibes and a lot of love to head into battle.\u201d</span></p>, <p><strong>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that President Trump appointed\xa0</strong></p>]

An additional 100 facilities likely face similar problems, but have been inaccessible because of flooding or other circumstances, Richard Carranza, the district\u2019s superintendent, told HuffPost.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools in other Houston-area districts have also suffered damage. But if Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, is any indication, the worst of Harvey\u2019s effects on education are still ahead. Katrina, which displaced more than 370,000 students in Mississippi and Louisiana, </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/04/the-lost-children-of-katrina/389345/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created a lost generation of students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who were forced from their homes and schools. As a result, their academic achievement was lower, their dropout rates were higher, and they struggled with joblessness even a decade after the storm.</span></p>, <p>School officials in Houston, which took in more Katrina evacuees than any other city, are leaning on the research, experiences and improved technology that came out of Katrina to implement plans to reduce Harvey\u2019s worst possible consequences for children \u2014 and to prevent the storm from negatively impacting students for generations to come.</p>, <p>Houston schools will provide <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/08/31/houston-school-district-give-students-3-free-meals-day-year-wake-hurricane-harvey-flooding/619895001/" target="_blank">three free meals a day</a> to every student during the upcoming school year, an expansion of an existing program. The district has also organized food and clothing drives with neighboring districts. When students and teachers return to school next week, crisis counselors will be waiting for them. Houston\u2019s district will also use technology to identify and track displaced and homeless students, Carranza said, a crucial step in implementing the lessons learned from Katrina.</p>, <p>But Houston can\u2019t successfully mitigate Harvey\u2019s worst educational impacts on its own. The school district has already faced crunched budgets and potential funding shortfalls. Experts who studied the aftermath of Katrina say an influx of money is necessary to hire staff and implement full recovery programs for displaced students who will need years of academic and emotional support.</p>, <p>And although the House of Representatives will take up its first Harvey-related legislation this week \u2014 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-harvey-aid-vote_us_59ad8671e4b0b5e531001f22?s1q">a $7.85 billion relief package</a> that will help the Federal Emergency Management Agency continue its efforts in Houston and other affected areas \u2014 Congress\u2019 crowded docket and looming spending fights could imperil future relief funding, included the sort of targeted education funding school districts need.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the vast majority of students, merely returning to the normalcy of school and receiving early counseling will be enough to recover, or come close to it. A year after Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992, </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/houston-flooding-harvey-how-to-help-kids-recover-from-disaster/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 80 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of students had recovered from the psychological trauma they experienced because of the storm, according to researchers. Even after Katrina, 71 percent of students had similarly recovered within two years of the storm making landfall, similar research found.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for some students, recovery will take longer \u2014 and that\u2019s where Houston and other affected districts need to avoid the biggest post-Katrina mistakes.</span></p>, <p>A year after Katrina made landfall, students the storm displaced missed more days of school and had lower rates of achievement than they did before the hurricane, according to Dr. Michael Ward, who, as an education professor at the University of Southern Mississippi, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tommy-armstrong-hurricane-katrina-kids_us_55de1c30e4b08cd3359e6ac1">studied Katrina\u2019s effects on students who moved schools</a>.</p>, <p>But their rates of suspension and discipline for misconduct also fell, suggesting that teachers and administrators were more understanding and lenient than they typically had been \u2014 that they \u201creally worked hard and really went out of their way to make sure that kids who had been displaced and suffered worst got the support and the help they needed from teachers,\u201d Ward said.</p>, <p>Five years after Katrina, however, rates of suspension for displaced students had skyrocketed beyond their pre-storm levels, and Mississippi\u2019s Katrina kids were twice as likely to drop out of school than students the storm hadn\u2019t displaced, Ward found. (The numbers were likely similar in Louisiana, he said.)</p>, <p>\u201cSo the lesson there appears to be that, if you\u2019re not thoughtful \u2014 if the adults in the process are not thoughtful \u2015 what will happen is that the needs of kids will outlast the patience of adults,\u201d Ward said. \u201cUnless there\u2019s a system for keeping track of kids who were displaced, the next school year they may end up with a teacher who doesn\u2019t know they experienced that sort of trauma. Two years out, five years out, it\u2019s kind of old history \u2014 except for the kids.\u201d</p>, <p>Houston and other districts, Ward said, will \u201cneed to maintain support systems around these kids for multiple years.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most vulnerable children \u2015 kids from poorer families and students of color\xa0\u2015 are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houston-harvey-environmental-justice_us_59a41c90e4b06d67e3390993">particularly likely to suffer</a> from the hurricane. Harvey has already had a disproportionate impact on those communities, and the demographics of Houston\u2019s public schools \u2014 in 2016, </span><a href="http://www.houstonisd.org/achievements"><span style="font-weight: 400;">62 percent of its students were Hispanic or Latino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while another 24 percent were African-American \u2014 suggests the educational outcome could be similarly unequal.</span></p>, <p>Texas doesn\u2019t have any near-term plans to provide extra money to help Houston and other school districts deal with the educational effects of Harvey. DeEtta Culbertson, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, said she was not yet aware of any plans for the state to step in to provide such funding, and last week, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said he <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/09/01/abbott-no-special-session-needed-harvey-aid/" target="_blank">would not call a special legislative session</a> to seek Harvey relief funding.</p>, <p>That leaves the feds. After Katrina, Congress approved $880 million in federal funding to assist school districts that took in displaced students, intended to help them hire staff and provide support to students in need.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the package, Congress granted each district $1,500 per displaced student, allowing districts to provide basic education services, reopen schools, and operate temporary facilities. But many districts said that funding fell short of what they needed, according to </span><a href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-839"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2011 assessment from the Government Accountability Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and only three of the 13 districts the GAO observed reported using the funds to hire new staff. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiring new counseling staff may be especially important in Texas. The state employs one school counselor for every 465 students, said Jill Cook, the assistant director of the American School Counselors Association, which recommends a ratio of one counselor for every 250 students.</span></p>, <p>School districts also reported that the verification process for the aid program proved challenging, according to the GAO. And district leaders told the agency that they were overly cautious in how they spent the money because they were unsure what costs it covered and feared they would have to return misused funds to the federal government.</p>, <p>Much of the federal aid, meanwhile, provided assistance only for the school year immediately following Katrina, even though children and their schools continued to deal with the storm years after it devastated the Gulf Coast. A federal package that helps avoid the failures of Katrina\u2019s recovery may need to be more ambitious than Congress\u2019 package a decade ago.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Congress have held committee-level discussions about education relief funding, though no dollar figure has been floated yet, one House Republican said. Carranza, the Houston superintendent, said that he has heard \u201cgood rumblings\u201d from lawmakers about \u201c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal support for all of the students who have been displaced and students who will be actually homeless.\u201d</span></p>, <p>The good news, Ward said, is that Katrina led to loads of new information about what does \u2014 and doesn\u2019t \u2014 help schools recover after a storm. The challenge now is to apply those lessons.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It\u2019s a worst-case scenario,\u201d Ward explained. \u201cKatrina was a 500-year flooding event, and you hope that we\u2019d have been spared something that catastrophic. But here we are again, and I\u2019d like to hope that the research and the dissemination of that research after Katrina is helping Texas school districts now.\u201d</span></p>, <p><em>Matt Fuller contributed reporting.</em></p>]

Paul Ryan, Of Course!</h1>|[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON \u2015 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">President Donald Trump</a> made a bad deal for Republicans on the debt limit and government funding, and, according to House conservatives, that\u2019s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/paul-ryan">Speaker Paul Ryan</a>\u2019s fault.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What?</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A day after Trump surprised his own party by taking the first offer from congressional Democrats to raise the debt ceiling and continue government spending for three months, many House conservatives have decided that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) is ultimately to blame for Trump\u2019s impulsive deal.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cLack of preparation leads to poor choices, and the fact that we weren\u2019t here \u2015 and you heard me say this the other night \u2015 we weren\u2019t here for six weeks, the longest non-election-year break we\u2019ve had in a decade,\u201d former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said Thursday, \u201cthat\u2019s a problem.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if Trump had effectively stepped in front of a bullet for Ryan by taking the blame for a bad deal that the speaker would have largely taken the responsibility for if the president had just stayed out of negotiations, Jordan said he wasn\u2019t here to blame anybody. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is we should have done what we had said back in July,\u201d Jordan answered. \u201cWe should have stayed here and put together a debt ceiling plan.\u201d</span></p>, <p>Obviously, Ryan has a lot of blame for a congressional recess, though the majority leader also has a say in the congressional schedule. But Jordan added that when lawmakers fail to prepare for deadlines, they don\u2019t have the best options come decision time.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That\u2019s not an unfair argument, but it ignores an obvious reality: This deal that Trump struck with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was a deal that Trump struck, not Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But time and again Thursday, conservatives ignored Trump\u2019s role in the agreement and found a way to blame the speaker.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think he saw the same-old, same-old kind of crap coming from leadership, and that wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) said of Trump, theorizing that the president was effectively preserving the debt limit issue until December.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As much as Gosar defended the president, he couldn\u2019t find an adequate reason to vote for the bill \u2015 he said he plans to oppose the package when it comes before the House \u2015 but Gosar noted he could see how this deal works to Trump\u2019s favor if the president plays his hand right.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That part seems unlikely. Lawmakers have repeatedly noted in the last two days that Trump just set a precedent that will be tough for him to break: He supported raising the debt ceiling without concessions, and he has agreed to fund the government without demanding money for his border wall.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Gosar acknowledged that Trump has made his negotiating position more difficult. \u201cHe may have lost that credibility,\u201d Gosar said. \u201cBut time will tell.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, conservatives generally refused to blame Trump for a deal that most of them believe to be bad for Republicans. Many said they couldn\u2019t answer questions until actually seeing the text of the deal. Many outright refused to answer questions. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about whether Donald Trump or Paul Ryan did a good or bad job,\u201d said Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And many others made tenuous connections between the deal and Paul Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI just see that the leadership team signed off on it and the rest of us find out about it,\u201d said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). King noted that Ryan and other GOP leaders didn\u2019t ever offer a conservative alternative to a clean increase in the debt ceiling \u2015 again, an argument that isn\u2019t wrong but somehow ignores the fact that Trump jumped at the chance for a clean debt limit.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) conveyed that he was disappointed in the deal. But even after he was presented with the argument that Ryan had called the Democratic offer \u201cridiculous\u201d Wednesday morning shortly before Trump took the offer, Gohmert said Ryan may actually have been a proponent of the deal. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if he was or not,\u201d the congressman said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderates generally welcomed Trump\u2019s deal, noting that the president had effectively cut out the Freedom Caucus from negotiations. \u201cTo me, the main positive of this deal is we\u2019re not gonna have one group of 30 or 40 have veto power,\u201d Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow a group of 30 or 40 to be setting policy for the House of Representatives.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as much as moderates were celebrating the compromised position of conservatives, conservatives were muted in their criticism \u2015 at least of Trump, who many believe is the key to overthrowing Ryan.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservatives have quietly been laying the groundwork for a coup against Ryan, pointing out with increasing frequency that the speaker had no plan to extract GOP concessions on the debt ceiling or a continuing resolution. But it\u2019s difficult to argue that this legislation is really Ryan\u2019s fault when Trump got out in front of it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have spun Trump\u2019s decision as one recognizing that Democrats were going to win this negotiation, so better to just \u201cclear the decks\u201d and perhaps allow Congress to focus on tax reform. But even that explanation is fraught. The short-term nature of the deal ensures that lawmakers will be focused on negotiating a broader deal in December, not just cutting taxes.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan\u2019s own defense of the agreement is that Trump saw a nation recovering from one hurricane and preparing for another, and he wanted a bipartisan moment rather than a protracted disagreement. That argument may work for some, but Trump has put Republicans in a bind for future negotiations, and he did so with little to no consultation from congressional leaders or his legislative affairs staff, according to one senior GOP aide familiar with discussions.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if Trump himself wanted to preserve his conservative credentials and damage Paul Ryan, he just went ahead and did the exact opposite. The question is whether that will matter to the far-right lawmakers who already seem to be plotting Ryan\u2019s fall.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Gosar was asked Thursday if he still supports Ryan as speaker, he repeatedly answered that he hadn\u2019t said \u201cone way or another.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if he would welcome Ryan campaigning for him, Gosar answered that he didn\u2019t have a challenger. Asked whether he would let Ryan even fundraise for him, Gosar said he didn\u2019t know about that, noting that Ryan was \u201cvery unpopular\u201d in his district.</span></p>]

During her 20-minute speech, DeVos called the current campus reporting process a \u201cfailed system\u201d that is \u201cincreasingly elaborate and confusing.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>She did not announce any large policy changes to Title IX other than implying that the\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-may-rescind-title-ix-guidelines-heres-what-that-could-mean_us_59aff829e4b0dfaafcf443e5?section=us_women">2011 Dear Colleague Letter</a>\xa0would be rescinded when she told the crowd\xa0\u201cthe era of rule by letter\u201d has ended.\xa0</p>, <p>The Obama-era\xa0<a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.pdf" target="_blank">Dear Colleague Letter</a>, which was created by then-Vice President Joe Biden in 2011, is a comprehensive set of guidelines that essentially serve as a reminder to universities and Title IX administrators that schools need to follow the Title IX law. \xa0</p>, <p>DeVos also announced two new approaches to the campus sexual violence reporting process that the Department of Education is exploring. The first is that the Department \u201cwill launch a transparent notice and comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties,\u201d including feedback from the public and educational institutions.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cNo one benefits from a system that does not have the public\u2019s trust,\u201d DeVos said, referring to the current Title IX system.\xa0</p>, <p>The second approach DeVos announced on Thursday is that the department will implement a regional reporting center model. The model would allow universities and colleges to opt in to local reporting centers that would partner with state attorneys general and law enforcement to ensure the reporting process runs fairly. \xa0</p>, <p>The Secretary of Education repeatedly discussed the rights of not only survivors of sexual assault, but also those who have been \u201cwrongly accused\u201d of sexual misconduct.</p>, <p>She allotted most of her speech to anecdotes about how the current Title IX system has failed survivors and those wrongly accused.</p>, <p>\u201cOne rape is one too many, one assault is one too many, one aggressive act of harassment is one too many, one person denied due process is one too many,\u201d DeVos told the crowd at George Mason. \u201cThis conversation may be uncomfortable, but we must have it. It is our moral obligation to get it right.\u201d</p>, <p>Although just between\xa0<a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/Publications_NSVRC_Overview_False-Reporting.pdf" target="_blank">2 and 10 percent</a> of reported rapes turn out to be false claims, DeVos devoted equal time to the stories of sexual assault survivors and those wrongly accused as if the group is the same size as survivors of sexual violence.</p>, <p>\u201cThis campus official, who may or may not have any training in adjudicating sexual misconduct, is expected to render a judgment,\u201d DeVos said, walking the crowd through the Title IX process. \u201cA judgment that changes the direction of\xa0<em>both</em>\xa0students\u2019 lives. The right to appeal may or may not be available to either party and no one is permitted to talk about what went on behind closed doors.\xa0It\u2019s no wonder so many call these proceedings kangaroo courts.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Notably, the groups that most often refer to Title IX proceedings as\xa0\u201c<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kangaroo%20court" target="_blank">kangaroo courts</a>\u201d are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/118-sexual-assault-survivors-write-letter-asking-trump-who-are-you-here-to-serve_us_59650307e4b005b0fdc8bcc6">Men\u2019s Rights Activists</a>\xa0and others who believe that the Title IX process is built to favor accusers over the accused.\xa0</p>, <p>While\xa0<a data-beacon-parsed="true" href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/overview-title-ix-education-amendments-1972-20-usc-1681-et-seq" target="_blank">Title IX is best known as a broad tool for enforcing</a>\xa0equal treatment of female and male student athletes, it also offers\xa0<a data-beacon-parsed="true" href="https://www.knowyourix.org/college-resources/title-ix/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other important protections</a>\xa0in areas including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and protections for trans and parenting students.\xa0In the past six months DeVos\xa0<a data-beacon-parsed="true" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-transgender_us_58ac4fe8e4b0a855d1d9d278">rescinded protections for transgender students</a>\xa0and made the investigation process for college sexual assault\xa0<a data-beacon-parsed="true" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/education-department-suit-title-ix-data_us_593f02d8e4b0b13f2c6d60ed?utm_hp_ref=betsy-devos" target="_blank">less transparent</a>, while also\xa0<a data-beacon-parsed="true" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-scaling-back-campus-rape-investigations_us_595e83ace4b02e9bdb0b441d?utm_hp_ref=betsy-devos">threatening to cut resources and funding</a>.</p>, <p>DeVos\u2019 announcement doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to many advocacy groups who have had concerns about the Secretary of Education\u2019s\xa0<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/08/03/betsy-devos-jacksons-title-ix-approach-fails-trust-women-debra-katz-hannah-alejandro-column/536000001/" target="_blank">views on Title IX</a>\xa0since she was\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-education-secretary-vote_us_5898fce6e4b0c1284f27c16b">confirmed in February</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>Before the announcement, survivor advocacy groups including End Rape on Campus and Know Your IX, NARAL and the Feminist Majority Foundation\xa0<a href="https://www.facebook.com/endrapeoncampus" target="_blank">rallied outside of the law school</a>\xa0as a sign of protest.

Before the Education Department took action to protect survivors, and hold schools accountable, too many young people were forced to drop classes they shared with their rapists, take long leaves of absence, or even leave school entirely. The Department\u2019s guidance, which outlined survivors\u2019 rights under longstanding federal law, was a response to this urgent reality.

I think about DACA, about the benefits it gave me to be able to continue my studies, to be employed by a home loan business, thanks to which I could buy a home for my parents who left Mexico City. And now what? We are in this limbo over what will happen to us.\u201d</p>, <p>Isaac Montiel, a 27-year-old student born in Puebla, Mexico, followed Sessions\u2019 announcement via social media while protesting outside the White House.</p>, <p>Montiel co-chairs the\xa0<a href="http://www.cunydreamers.org/">CUNY Dreamers</a>\xa0group and is one of 28 Dreamers on a four-day hunger strike. \u201cI am angry, frustrated, but I also want to continue fighting for a permanent solution from Congress,\u201d he said.\xa0</p>, <p>Individuals who currently have DACA protections will begin to lose their work permits in six months, putting hundreds of thousands of young U.S. residents at risk of being sent away from the country they\u2019ve lived in since they were children \u2015 unless members of the U.S. House and Senate can agree on legislation to protect them.\xa0</p>, <p>Mexico City-born Jos\xe9 Eduardo Morales, who now lives in Utah, wasn\u2019t surprised by the decision.\xa0\u201cI already knew what was going to happen, but it was difficult to process,\u201d Morales said. \u201cI felt a little disoriented, defenseless, uncertain. My permit is still valid for a year, and right now I am completing a graduate degree in education.\u201d</p>, <p>Morales said that while he can\u2019t travel to Washington D.C. to take part in protests, he\u2019s using the tools at his disposal to support them. He says the\xa0<a href="https://www.usmexicofound.org/">U.S.-Mexico Foundation</a>\xa0has advised Dreamers to stay on top of the news, and that they\u2019re also staying connected through WhatsApp.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThis is causing us emotional and physical stress,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I have two more years left to complete my studies and if I can complete them, I will use my graduate degree here to help my community in many ways.\u201d</p>, <p>Rebecca Vargas, who co-chairs the\xa0<a href="https://www.usmexicofound.org/">U.S.-Mexico Foundation</a>, said dialogue and educating members of Congress will be crucial in the weeks and months ahead. \u201cThe only benefit of this announcement is that if we achieve something in Congress, it should be permanent, not temporary, as DACA was,\u201d she explained.\xa0</p>, <p>Amid the insecurity about what lies ahead, Dreamers have expressed a wide range of fears, including whether they\u2019d be at risk of deportation and whether the U.S. government will make use of the data they provided when they applied for the program, including their place of residence, work or school.\xa0\xa0</p>, <p>Eunice Rend\xf3n, director of <a href="http://agendamigrante.mx/">Agenda Migrante</a>, said that an additional worry is the Mexican government\u2019s lack of sufficient preparation for the possible return of these young people.</p>, <p>\u201cMexico is not completely ready to receive [so many] of these young people. There are efforts and political willingness, but I do not see a comprehensive return policy,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to be clear on the fact that U.S. legislators \u2015 who ultimately will be the ones to resolve these young people\u2019s current situation \u2015 can also be pressured via the media and social justice groups.\u201d</p>, <p>Rend\xf3n also noted Dreamers\u2019 contributions to the U.S. economy \u2015 according to the Center for American Progress,\xa0deporting Dreamers will result in a <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2017/07/21/436419/new-threat-daca-cost-states-billions-dollars/" target="_blank">$460 billion loss</a> to the U.S. GDP over the next 10 years.</p>, <p>\u201cMore than <a href="https://cdn.americanprogress.org/content/uploads/2017/08/27164928/Wong-Et-Al-New-DACA-Survey-2017-Codebook.pdf" target="_blank">98 percent of them are bilingual, 91 percent are formally employed, and 70 percent have completed higher education</a>," Rend\xf3n said. "They are the ideal citizen for any country! Trump may have a majority in Congress, but we have not forgotten that there are many Republicans who have voted against his decisions.\u201d <strong>\xa0</strong></p>, <p>That\u2019s why Montiel did not await Session\u2019s announcement in New York, where he lives, but in Washington, D.C., where he traveled to lend his voice to the chorus of protesters. \u201cWe are not giving up! Hopefully the Mexican government will announce their support for us. Thinking about returning [to Mexico] would be one of my last alternatives,\u201d he said.\xa0</p>, <p>Alem\xe1n echoed his sentiment. \u201cFor my family, it would be very difficult to return to our country,\u201d she acknowledged, \u201cbut most of all for me, who grew up in this country. Going back to Mexico would be like returning to nothing.\u201d</p>, <p><em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/09/05/regresar-a-mexico-seria-como-volver-a-la-nada-dreamers-reciben-asi-el-final-de-daca_a_23198156/?utm_hp_ref=mx-homepage">This story was first published by HuffPost Mexico.

These guys are now hostage to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.\u201d</p>, <p>House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and even Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, had wanted an 18-month extension of the debt ceiling, pushing its expiration to beyond the 2018 congressional elections. Increasing the statutory debt limit does not increase debt, but merely authorizes the government to pay debts already incurred. Nevertheless, in recent decades, lawmakers \u2015 especially Republicans \u2015 have conflated the two in their campaigns for office, and prefer to minimize the number of times they must cast debt-ceiling votes. Thanks to Trump, they will now have two such votes in a matter of three months heading into primary election season.</p>, <p>One of those wrapped up Friday, with the House overwhelmingly passing a package that included $15 billion for Hurricane Harvey relief, a three-month government funding bill, and the Schumer-Pelosi three-month debt ceiling extension. The Senate had already passed it on Thursday.</p>, <p>\u201cHe insists on loyalty, never gives any back,\u201d said John Weaver, who worked on Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s bid for the GOP presidential nomination last year.</p>, <p>Other Republicans, who supported Trump once he had secured the nomination and defended him because they believed he would approve GOP legislative priorities, saw this latest move as a threat to their agenda. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s going to play the Democrats off the Republicans,\u201d said one longtime Republican National Committee member who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cRyan and McConnell better plan for more.\u201d</p>, <p>Many of the same Republicans surprised and dismayed by Trump\u2019s move had openly embraced him a year ago. They pushed on voters the idea that he was a smart, wealthy business executive \u2013 that despite a record that included scores of lawsuits, four bankruptcies and a relatively low net worth given that he began four decades ago with a business worth $1 billion in today\u2019s dollars.</p>, <p>That actual history, Wilson said, should have guided congressional leaders as they dealt with his White House. \u201cHe\u2019s never kept a vow, contract or agreement. Ever. Sane people know he\u2019s a lying liar who lies at all times,\u201d he said, attributing Trump\u2019s successful image to his hit television show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not really a business guy. He\u2019s a guy who played a business guy on TV.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s defenders say that if Republicans are angry about Trump choosing to work with Democrats, they have only themselves to blame for failing to give Trump legislative successes during his first seven months in office. \u201cThey\u2019ve been openly hostile to him for months. This is the price they pay,\u201d Caputo said. \u201cHe taught the Republicans a lesson they sorely needed.\u201d</p>, <p>Weaver disputed that congressional Republicans have been holding Trump back, arguing that Trump\u2019s failure to achieve any significant legislation on his priorities this year was due entirely to the president\u2019s lack of serious interest in any issue. \u201cWhich is what?\u201d Weaver said about Trump\u2019s supposed priorities. \u201cOther than blocking the Russia investigation, I\u2019m not sure what he wanted.\u201d</p>, <p>He warned his fellow Republicans that the worst was likely yet to come, with Trump continuing to abandon GOP legislative goals in favor of whatever he happens to seize upon at that moment \u2013 and taking his strongest supporters with him, endangering Republicans in next fall\u2019s elections.</p>, <p>\u201cHis hardcore 20 percent?\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThey don\u2019t really care about Paul Ryan\u2019s Ayn Rand agenda or Mitch McConnell\u2019s apparatchik agenda.</p>, <p><em>This story was updated to include congressional votes on the three-month debt limit proposal.</em></p>]

First Amendment intrusion occurs where a public accommodations law compels someone to create expression for a particular person or entity and to participate, literally or figuratively, in a ceremony or other expressive event.\u201d</p>, <p>Businesses and other places that are considered \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d are barred by law from discriminating against people on the basis of factors like race and religion.\xa0The DOJ brief suggests that such laws should not be able to compel artists to create\xa0\u201cinherently communicative\u201d goods, like wedding cakes.</p>, <p>DOJ\u2019s filing raises the possibility that if the Masterpiece Cakeshop can\u2019t refuse to bake a cake for the marriage of a same-sex couple, then a freelance graphic designer who designs flyers for Jewish affinity groups might also be forced to do so \u201cfor a neo-Nazi group or the Westboro Baptist Church.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cA custom wedding cake can be sufficiently artistic to qualify as pure speech, akin to a sculptural centerpiece,\u201d the Justice Department wrote. \u201cIn short, a custom wedding cake is not an ordinary baked good; its function is more communicative and artistic than utilitarian.\u201d</p>, <p>If forced to create such a cake for a gay couple, the DOJ brief argues, Phillips would be required to essentially \u201cparticipate in a wedding celebration that conflicts with his sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d</p>, <p>The Justice Department also noted that, at the time Phillips refused to make the cake for David Mullins and Charlie Craig in July 2012, the state of Colorado did not recognize same-sex marriages.</p>, <p>\u201cIn other words, the State itself did not acknowledge the validity of the union it sought to compel petitioners to celebrate,\u201d DOJ wrote. \u201cEspecially given that background, the State has not advanced a sufficient state interest to override petitioners\u2019 weighty First Amendment interest in declining to create the expression at issue here.\u201d</p>, <p>In a statement, a Justice Department spokeswoman said the amicus brief was filed to protect the free expression of all Americans.</p>, <p>\u201cAlthough public-accommodations laws serve important purposes, they \u2015 like other laws \u2015 must yield to the individual freedoms that the First Amendment guarantees,\u201d said spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam. \u201cThat includes the freedom not to create expression for ceremonies that violate one\u2019s religious beliefs.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Louise Melling, deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the brief \u201cwas shocking, even for this administration.\u201d She said the Trump administration \u201cis advocating for nothing short of a constitutional right to discriminate.\u201d</p>, <p><strong>Read the Justice Department\u2019s filing below.</strong></p>]

She loved her gig, which she said paid $7.25 an hour plus tips, and was saving up to move out of her parent\u2019s house. Then, Hurricane Harvey hit.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flood engulfed the golf clubhouse and ruined<strong>\xa0</strong>equipment. At first, Averill thought she\u2019d be able to return to work, eventually. But days later, after the storm had settled, her managers sent the staff information about signing up for unemployment benefits, the 18-year-old college student said. Managers at the business could not be reached for comment, though their website notes that the club is closed \u201cuntil further notice\u201d because of Harvey.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThey\u2019re definitely trying to help and do everything that they can,\u201d she said. But in the meantime, she has bills to pay, including insurance and gas. It\u2019s \u201chard trying to get back into the job world,\u201d she said, </span>adding she\u2019s worried there are a lot of people applying for jobs.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During any major hurricane, victims are left to deal with </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-your-house-floods_us_59a6f2ffe4b084581a14f734"><span style="font-weight: 400;">devastating flooding, ruined homes, lost possessions, and unusable cars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But a disaster on the scale of Harvey\u2014and potentially, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-irma_us_59aeb3abe4b0dfaafcf2ac67">Hurricane Irma</a>\u2014can also wipe out livelihoods. A number of Texans are finding that the storm has destroyed their workplaces, and many don\u2019t know when they will reopen. One person, who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity because he didn\u2019t want to jeopardize his job, forwarded an email his Texas-based employer sent out.\xa0He said the company was docking staff salaries as a result of Harvey-related losses.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still more Texans may have been fired simply because they couldn\u2019t get to work during the storm. Amanda Bosley, a legal fellow at Lone Star Legal Aid in Houston, which had its <a href="http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/apparent_explosion_and_fire_damage_legal_aid_office_in_houston" target="_blank">headquarters damaged by Harvey</a>, told HuffPost she had spoken to one such person so far, but suspected \u201cthere are many more.\u201d </span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 49 states, including Texas, people are employed \u201cat-will,\u201d which means you can be \u201cfired for good, bad, or no reason at all,\u201d said Paul Secunda, a law professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who assisted victims during Hurricane Katrina. \u201cThere is no job security.\u201d </span></p>, <p>There is federal funding available to people who have faced job repercussions as a direct result of a major disaster \u2015 a state administered program known as <a href="https://www.benefits.gov/benefits/benefit-details/597" target="_blank">Disaster Unemployment Assistance</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As of Tuesday, the Texas Workforce Commission had taken about 75,300 disaster-related unemployment insurance claims, agency spokeswoman Lisa Givens told HuffPost via email. She added that the agency is still in the process of determining who is eligible.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases,\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an <a href="https://twitter.com/Schrader_Adam/status/902655649963806720" target="_blank">employer and employee may disagree</a> about why the person was fired. But when it comes to benefits, \u201cw</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e make decisions about eligibility based on the individual situations,\u201d Givens said. \u201cIn general, a person must have lost their job through no fault of their own.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aid <a href="http://www.twc.state.tx.us/jobseekers/disaster-unemployment-assistance#applyingForDua" target="_blank">extends to people who were scheduled to start a new job</a>\xa0that no longer exists due to the storm. It also applies to people who have suffered a disaster-related injury. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half a million people lost their jobs after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and there was an increase in applicants for both regular unemployment insurance and DUA benefits, according to a </span><a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07219.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2007 Government Accountability Office report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (With DUA, people already on unemployment cannot get additional disaster-related benefits.)\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark Levi Betancourt, 34, was a full-time employee of Woody\u2019s Sports Center, which charters boat trips, in Port Aransas, Texas. Harvey forced him to evacuate, and his family is now fundraising to replace his damaged trailer home. He says he\u2019s been busy helping older people in the trailer park since the storm, cleaning out houses and putting garbage on the curb. But even if he could make it to his job, there\u2019s no work to go back to. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sports Center docks are unusable, and power and water lines are wiped out. Glenn Martin, the president of the business, estimates they\u2019re not going to reopen for at least two months. Employees can help out with some reconstruction, but Martin doesn\u2019t expect there to be a full-time job available for a while.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Betancourt said the storm is \u201churting a lot of people emotionally.\u201d But he felt like he was already struggling financially and living paycheck to paycheck.\xa0\u201cI\u2019ve been living on the bottom forever, it\u2019s not like I had far to fall.\u201d Despite that, he said he is conflicted about applying for disaster unemployment: \u201cI\u2019ve never taken a free dollar in my life.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As in past disasters, the federal government has given extra food stamp benefits to people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program who live in counties affected by the storm.

The 3-0 ruling takes effect in five days.</p>, <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that Trump\u2019s ban could be implemented on a limited basis, but should not be applied to people with \u201cbona fide\u201d relationships to people or entities in the United States.</p>, <p>The government took a narrow view of that interpretation, which the state of Hawaii challenged in court. A lower court judge sided with Hawaii, and the 9th Circuit judges upheld that view.</p>, <p>\u201cIt is hard to see how a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, sibling-in-law, or cousin can be considered to have no bona fide relationship with their relative in the United States,\u201d the court said.</p>, <p>The court also rejected the administration\u2019s argument that the written assurances provided by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees is not a bona fide relationship.</p>, <p>The agencies\u2019 advance preparation and expenditure of resources for each refugee \u201csupports the district court\u2019s determination that a bona fide relationship with the refugee exists,\u201d the decision said.</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s first version of the executive order, signed in January, sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world before it was blocked by courts. The administration replaced that version of the ban with a new order in March in response to the legal challenges.</p>, <p>A Department of Justice spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the Executive Branch\u2019s duty to protect the Nation.\u201d</p>, <p>Hawaii\u2019s Attorney General Douglas Chin said the ruling \u201ckeeps families together. It gives vetted refugees a second chance. The Trump administration keeps taking actions with no legal basis. We will keep fighting back.\u201d</p>, <p>Refugee organizations cheered Thursday\u2019s decision, saying it will give relief to people fleeing violence who were caught in limbo after the ban.</p>, <p>The broader question of whether the revised travel ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution will be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in October.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>(Reporting by Mica Rosenberg and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley in Washington; editing by Sue Horton and Grant McCool)</p>]

Now they\u2019re living in a San Antonio motel, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying for the room until Sept.\xa026. (State governments, though, can collaborate with FEMA and\xa0</span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/news-release/2017/08/29/transitional-shelter-assistance"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extend stays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for up to six months.)</span>\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">Estrada said she has no idea what she and her family will do once that ends. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cAfter the 26th, we will be in the streets,\u201d she said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing that has made the ordeal a little more bearable: extra food stamp benefits. To make up for all the food lost in powerless refrigerators and ruined kitchens, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services on Friday\xa0</span><a href="https://hhs.texas.gov/about-hhs/communications-events/news-releases/2017/09/texas-announces-food-benefits-victims-hurricane-harvey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reissued the benefit allotment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the month of August to more than 700,000 people who had been receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in 58 Harvey-afflicted counties. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe were really hungry, and when we got them food stamps, we were so happy,\u201d Estrada said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state also distributed September benefits on the first of the month, rather than following the usual practice of staggering delivery over several days. Estrada would normally have received her $194 benefit on Sept. 6.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees food stamps, approved the replacement benefits and the early September distribution</span> last week. The USDA also agreed to waive SNAP\u2019s prohibition on using benefits for prepared meals; the program typically restricts purchases to food products for home consumption. Estrada said she\u2019s been able to use her benefits for chicken tenders and fries at Walmart.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the USDA </span><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2017/09/07/usda-tda-more-food-help-way-households-hit-harvey"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a plan to distribute boxes of food directly to people\u2019s houses. Sometime soon, a department spokesman said, Texas will probably also be able to distribute special disaster benefits, known as D-SNAP, that can be used by storm victims who didn\u2019t already qualify for food stamps because of poverty. (Such disaster benefits are typically rolled out later in a storm recovery since it\u2019s necessary for retail stores to be up and running for the benefits to be redeemed.) </span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extra food stamp benefits have long been an important part of the federal government\u2019s response to disasters, which partly reflects the program\u2019s built-in responsiveness to economic need. The USDA distributed $320 million worth of disaster and replacement food stamps last year, plus emergency food supplies. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, the department distributed more than $680 million worth of disaster SNAP assistance to nearly 1.5 million households. </span>The money comes from the program\u2019s budget and doesn\u2019t need an additional appropriation from Congress.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nutrition program isn\u2019t a first responder, said Ellen Vollinger of the Food Research &amp; Action Center. \u201cBut within the world of government relief programs,\u201d she said, \u201cSNAP is considered a pretty important near-term responder.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other federal nutrition programs, including the National School Lunch Program and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program For Women, Infants and Children, also typically relax rules for people affected by major disasters. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Victoria is about an hour north from where Harvey made landfall. Estrada, along with her girlfriend, her girlfriend\u2019s two young children, and their dog, fled to San Antonio the day before the storm arrived. For a week they stayed in a shelter, sleeping in a room with hundreds of other people. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They got the motel room on Friday. Estrada said she is disabled and had to use all of her monthly Supplemental Security Income check to pay for necessities like gas, clothes and cleaning supplies. The SNAP benefits have been a huge help. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe\u2019re spending our own money to where we don\u2019t have no more money and we\u2019re out of gas,\u201d she said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People at the motel have been incredibly nice, she said, and someone even gave them free tickets to Six Flags, which was a thrill for her girlfriend\u2019s 9-year-old and 6-year-old. After they returned, the person who gave them the tickets asked the kids if they had fun and was surprised that they didn\u2019t seem more enthusiastic. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe lady was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with them?\u2019 They\u2019re still dazed on it. I guess they don\u2019t get it. They want to go home,\u201d Estrada said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThey\u2019re missing a lot of school and we don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</span></p>]

The 3-0 ruling takes effect in five days.</p>, <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that Trump\u2019s ban could be implemented on a limited basis, but should not be applied to people with \u201cbona fide\u201d relationships to people or entities in the United States.</p>, <p>The government took a narrow view of that interpretation, which the state of Hawaii challenged in court. A lower court judge sided with Hawaii, and the 9th Circuit judges upheld that view.</p>, <p>\u201cIt is hard to see how a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, sibling-in-law, or cousin can be considered to have no bona fide relationship with their relative in the United States,\u201d the court said.</p>, <p>The court also rejected the administration\u2019s argument that the written assurances provided by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees is not a bona fide relationship.</p>, <p>The agencies\u2019 advance preparation and expenditure of resources for each refugee \u201csupports the district court\u2019s determination that a bona fide relationship with the refugee exists,\u201d the decision said.</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s first version of the executive order, signed in January, sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world before it was blocked by courts. The administration replaced that version of the ban with a new order in March in response to the legal challenges.</p>, <p>A Department of Justice spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the Executive Branch\u2019s duty to protect the Nation.\u201d</p>, <p>Hawaii\u2019s Attorney General Douglas Chin said the ruling \u201ckeeps families together. It gives vetted refugees a second chance. The Trump administration keeps taking actions with no legal basis. We will keep fighting back.\u201d</p>, <p>Refugee organizations cheered Thursday\u2019s decision, saying it will give relief to people fleeing violence who were caught in limbo after the ban.</p>, <p>The broader question of whether the revised travel ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution will be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in October.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>(Reporting by Mica Rosenberg and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley in Washington; editing by Sue Horton and Grant McCool)</p>]

Jennifer Wexton (D-Leesburg), initially considered the favorite to win the nomination, is facing an unexpectedly stiff challenge. After <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2018&amp;id=VA10" target="_blank">the first two fundraising quarters of 2018</a>, Wexton has been heavily outraised by three opponents: former State Department official and anti-human trafficking advocate Alison Kiehl Friedman; Army veteran and business strategist Dan Helmer; and Obama administration alumnus and communications consultant Lindsey Davis Stover. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friedman, already leading the pack in fundraising thanks to an early endorsement from the feminist activist and writer Gloria Steinem, is set to announce several high-profile endorsements in the days and weeks to come \u2015 including one this week from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/khizr-khan" target="_blank">Khizr Khan</a>, an outspoken critic of Trump whose son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, was killed while deployed in Iraq in 2004. In an </span><a href="https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2017/09/05/59aecbf3e4b0b5e531012cac.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsement letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provided to HuffPost, Khan, writing as \u201ca proud Virginian patriot,\u201d praises Friedman\u2019s work \u201cserving people who are often ignored or left out.\u201d Friedman, whose mother, Kristina Kiehl, co-founded the reproductive rights group Voters for Choice with Steinem, has benefited from deep ties to a nationwide network of progressive activists.</span></p>, <p>Friedman isn\u2019t the only rookie candidate lining up high-profile endorsements. Davis Stover is set to appear alongside reproductive rights activist and former Texas state Sen. Wendy Davis, and recently held an event with Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who worked with Davis Stover at the Department of Veterans Affairs in the Obama administration.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe bring a lot of depth of federal experience to this race,\u201d Davis Stover told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019ve lived many of the challenges people are facing right now.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helmer, meanwhile, has received a number of endorsements from the national security establishment \u2015 which is heavily represented in Comstock\u2019s district, thanks to its proximity to Washington\xa0\u2015 including former Obama administration official Michele Flournoy and the progressive veterans organization VoteVets.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That many of the most competitive candidates weren\u2019t even on the district\u2019s political radar a year ago is striking evidence of how the surge in political engagement on the left, prompted by Trump\u2019s contentious administration, is reshuffling just who makes up the party \u201cestablishment.\u201d This, in turn, is forcing <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/democratic-party" target="_blank">Democratic Party</a> officials to take a more passive approach to elections, as grassroots activists and members of the party\u2019s myriad factions jockey for position. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, had recruited Wexton and </span><a href="http://dccc.org/icymi-rating-change-va-10-wexton-bid-moves-comstock-toss/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> heralded her entrance into the race earlier this year, but was forced to sit back as more candidates threw their hats in the ring. Now, instead of focusing its efforts solely on Wexton, the DCCC is providing assistance to a number of candidates and is coordinating anti-Comstock messaging where it can. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wexton still sports the deepest endorsement bench, including Reps. Gerry Connolly and Donald McEachin, both Virginia Democrats, as well as a slew of state legislators, county supervisors, school board officials and other local political operators. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Wexton said her ties to the district set her apart from the crowded field and could tip the balance in the party\u2019s favor next November, calling herself \u201ca proven vote-getter here in the district.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She attributed her underwhelming fundraising numbers to her donor base being centered in Virginia \u2015 drawing an implicit contrast with her opponents who have enjoyed an influx of outside money. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot going on in Virginia,\u201d Wexton said. \u201cI have no doubt that my number will continue to be strong. I don\u2019t think that the one with the most money always wins.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Democratic Party officials, all requesting anonymity to speak candidly, say they still favor Wexton, citing her history in the district and her connections to Loudon County, which proved to be a major swing county in recent elections. However, these same officials remain confident that Wexton\u2019s major primary challengers would be well-positioned to unseat Comstock next November. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis is the problem you want to have,\u201d said Lowell Feld, editor of the progressive political site Blue Virginia, of the glut of strong Democratic candidates.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feld noted that while the party\u2019s recent gubernatorial primary pitted former Rep.\xa0Tom Perriello (Va.), a progressive, against the state\u2019s more centrist Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the ideological differences in the Virginia 10th field are less pronounced. Candidates will ultimately distinguish themselves, he said, by which issues they focus on. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou also have to have your own personal and political narrative,\u201d Feld said. \u201cPeople want to be for something.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia\u2019s 10th District is\xa0\u2015 not to mince words \u2015 a <a href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/cong_dist/cd115/cd_based/ST51/CD115_VA10.pdf" target="_blank">gerrymandered monstrosity</a> that covers large swaths of the state\u2019s northeastern border with West Virginia and Maryland before oozing into D.C.\u2019s western suburbs. Stare at it long enough, and you might think the state legislature was aiming to replicate mainland Greece with its mix of peninsulas and isthmuses dipping into the Washington area. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district includes rural Frederick County, which borders West Virginia and voted 65 percent for Trump in the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/elections-2016" target="_blank">2016 election</a>, as well as large portions of Fairfax County, which voted 65 percent for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/hillary-clinton" target="_blank">Hillary Clinton</a>. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia microcosms go, you couldn\u2019t find a better example than the 10th District. Like the Commonwealth itself, the 10th leans Democratic thanks to a very liberal professional population around Washington, offset by a large, mostly conservative rural constituency. However, as a congressional district that is ostensibly supposed to possess a coherent demographic identity, it\u2019s a mess.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinton won the district in November by 10 points, but Comstock outperformed the top of the Republican ticket by roughly 15 points. Feld attributes much of Comstock\u2019s success to an erroneous assumption among voters in the district that she is more moderate than her record suggests. FiveThirtyEight </span><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/barbara-comstock/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Comstock has voted in line with Trump\u2019s presidential agenda 95 percent of the time. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI don\u2019t think people follow it that closely and the Post gave her a free license,\u201d said Feld, referring to The Washington Post editorial board\u2019s decision to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-posts-picks-for-congress/2016/10/22/75fe0dd2-962d-11e6-bb29-bf2701dbe0a3_story.html?utm_term=.f29f825b2a3b" target="_blank">endorse Comstock</a> in 2016. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alison Kiehl Friedman also attributed much of Comstock\u2019s support to the district\u2019s politically keyed-in population. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think a lot of voters made the choice to support her as a check on a Clinton presidency,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cI think the congresswoman has historically been able to get by without having to dive down into the issues or really taking a stand for much, and she\u2019s not going to get by this time.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Comstock campaign did not respond to requests for an interview. However, Maddie Anderson, a regional press secretary for the National Republican Congressional Committee, cited the congresswoman\u2019s previous electoral wins as evidence of her political strength. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe Democrats have run the same failed strategy in all five of Rep. Comstock\u2019s victorious races in which they threw almost $20 million down the drain which could have been used on closer races every election,\u201d Anderson said in a statement provided to HuffPost. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comstock\u2019s support of Trump\u2019s agenda is likely to be a key factor in the race. Democrats across the country are planning to make the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/trump-administration" target="_blank">Trump administration</a> a central issue of the midterms, and indeed the ascent of Trump is what prompted many of the candidates to run in the first place.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsey Davis Stover recalled participating in the Women\u2019s March on Washington with her two daughters the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think it\u2019s such an important time when we can no longer sit on the sidelines, and we have to do things we\u2019d never thought we\u2019d do before,\u201d she said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Helmer says he was contacted by New Politics, an organization that, per its website, helps \u201cpromising national service alumni and military veterans run for public office.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He described Trump\u2019s victory as an animating moment. \u201cOn January 20th,\u201d he said, \u201cas [my wife] and I watched the inauguration, we asked ourselves, \u2018What are we going to tell our sons what we did?\u2019\u201d </span></p>]

Brooklyn\u2019s own <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/chuck-schumer">Chuck Schumer</a> plunged right in on Queens-born <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>.</p>, <p>On Wednesday, the president had unexpectedly agreed with Schumer, the Democrats\u2019 Senate leader, and Nancy Pelosi, his House counterpart, to put off major battles over the federal budget and national debt until December. It was widely seen as a victory for Democrats and a humiliation for Republicans.</p>, <p>Trump invited Schumer, whom he\u2019d once described as the \u201chead clown\u201d of the Democratic Party, to join him in briefing the press on the deal.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>Schumer, with a smile, demurred.</p>, <p>\u201cIf I do that, you could say something unexpected,\u201d Schumer said with a laugh. \u201cThen I\u2019d have to explain it.\u201d Trump smiled in response.</p>, <p>Then, turning to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, Schumer added, \u201cAnd I bet you have that problem a lot more than I do.\u201d</p>, <p>Everyone laughed at that one.</p>, <p>The moment was caught on camera by photographers who used telephoto lenses to peer through an Oval Office window. This account of what was said comes from friends of Schumer\u2019s, to whom he recounted the conversation. His office declined to comment.</p>, <p>The deal to provide hurricane relief, while hiking the debt ceiling and funding the government for just three months, was indeed a gift to Democrats. With majorities in both chambers of Congress, the GOP will be vulnerable to pressure on immigration and other matters as a Christmas-time shutdown of the government and its borrowing power looms.</p>, <p>It was a moment evocative of the master wheeler-dealer Lyndon Johnson \u2015 with Schumer, not Trump, in the role of mastermind\xa0\u2015 and it was entirely unexpected. The New York senator had not talked to the president in months, and neither Schumer nor anyone else in the room thought that Trump would accept the three-month deal.</p>, <p>But if Schumer was lucky this week, he deserves it. He\u2019s admired by his Democratic colleagues and even by many Republicans for his knowledge, his shrewdness, his businesslike approachability \u2015 and, at 66 years of age, his energy and almost childlike enjoyment of his job.</p>, <p>\u201cHe simply <em>loves</em>\xa0what he does,\u201d said Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.).</p>, <p>A near-parody of studiousness \u2015 reportedly perfect SATs, Harvard and Harvard Law attendance, a disheveled mien that led one magazine to call him a \u201czhlub, in a good way\u201d \u2015 Schumer does not manage by LBJ-like instinct. It\u2019s all preparation.</p>, <p>As his colleagues describe his methods, Schumer is constantly calling them to check in, ask their opinion and give them a heads-up. He knows the details.</p>, <p>And he knows the history. When Schumer was elected Senate leader by his fellow Democrats, legendary LBJ biographer Robert Caro sent him a signed copy of\xa0<em>Master of the Senate</em>, Caro\u2019s 1,167-page account of Johnson\u2019s years as Democratic leader. Schumer, of course, had already read it.</p>, <p>After Trump was elected, observers expected that the new president would \u2015 and would need to \u2015 lean on the advice and experience of GOP congressional leaders. But that did not stop Schumer from reaching out to Trump before the inauguration. Bipartisan deals were possible, Schumer said, especially on infrastructure and even tax reform.</p>, <p>Relations, such as they were, soured as Schumer rigorously kept his entire caucus in line to oppose the dismantling of Obamacare. It was a tour-de-force of legislative defiance and ended in an embarrassing defeat for his counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who could not keep his troops in line. Trump blamed McConnell for the failure. A private shouting match reportedly followed, and the two have only a minimally correct relationship at this point.</p>, <p>But Schumer has thought from the start that he might be a better negotiating partner for his fellow New Yorker than would the dour Kentuckian.</p>, <p>He and Trump share quite a bit. They are outer-borough attention-seekers who love to be in the news and to make deals. From Brooklyn and Queens respectively, they both recognized that their route to power ran through Manhattan and its banks, media barons and powerbrokers. Neither is much of a philosopher or an ideologue. Both think they deserve the thanks and admiration of working men and women.</p>, <p>Schumer\u2019s challenge now is to be more than a one-day LBJ, by helping his party achieve good deals on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (which he pressed Trump about again on Thursday),\xa0tax reform, Obamacare and other matters.</p>, <p>It won\u2019t be easy. He has told colleagues that he has no idea whether the Wednesday deal is a one-off or the beginning of something lasting.</p>, <p>Schumer is lowering expectations, which is just what LBJ would be doing right now.</p>]

It also gives Democrats leverage to demand significant policy concessions in December, since the two previously separate deadlines are now due to coincide, skeptics warned.</p>, <p>But some of the president\u2019s critics are even more frustrated with Ryan and McConnell for allowing the deadline to approach without an apparent strategy to extract policy wins from Democrats, losing the president\u2019s confidence in the process.</p>, <p>If the two congressmen had a plan for the upcoming deadlines, members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus were not aware of it, according to Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, a conservative activism group with ties to the hardline Republican faction.</p>, <p>\u201cI put most of it on [Ryan and McConnell] to be honest. You had a lot of time and we were just getting closer to [the government funding deadline of] September 30,\u201d Brandon said.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI blame McConnell and Ryan first. Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do: He said he likes debt; he said he was gong to expand spending; and he said that when the time was right, he would pivot to working with Democrats,\u201d said Matt Kibbe, president of Free The People, a libertarian-leaning conservative advocacy group. \xa0\xa0</p>, <p>Failing to prioritize passage of a full-year budget earlier this year, weakened Ryan and McConnell\u2019s bargaining leverage, Kibbe said. Had they gotten further along in the budgeting process, Kibbe suggested, they would not be faced with the prospect of appearing to hold up emergency funding to deal with two historic hurricanes.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThey want to play the last-minute brinksmanship game and they always lose that game \u2015 every single time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have created this situation where they don\u2019t have a card to play.\u201d</p>, <p>Meanwhile, the more nationalist-oriented conservatives that make up Trump\u2019s base shared the fiscal hawks\u2019 criticism of Ryan and McConnell, even as they defended Trump\u2019s deal with the Democrats.</p>, <p>Congressional Republican leaders have squandered the president\u2019s trust by failing to shepherd an Affordable Care Act repeal and other Trump priorities, according to Trump partisans. Cutting a deal with Democrats was a necessary message to Republicans to get their act together, according to John Gilmore, who runs the <a href="http://conservativeminnesotans.blogspot.com/">Minnesota Conservatives blog</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cTrump is saying: If you don\u2019t deal with me, I\u2019ll deal with somebody else,\u201d Gilmore said.</p>, <p>Ryan and McConnell had first proposed an 18-month government funding and debt ceiling extension, and then a 6-month extension.</p>, <p>But Ryan and McConnell have not proven that they can corral the moderates in their caucus who waver at the first sign of a fight with Democrats, Yossi Gestetner, a pro-Trump commentator, argued on Twitter.</p>, <p>Knowing that, Trump decided to avoid a prolonged process where he could be \u201ctripped by \u2018righteous\u2019 GOPers,\u201d according to Gestetner.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Instead of Trump trying to hold the line and then be tripped by "righteous" GOPers, he went right away where things would anyway go: 2 Dems!</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>John Nolte, an editor-at-large at Breitbart, drew a similar conclusion on Twitter.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">GOP totally controls the govt and gets NOTHING done. <br/><br/>Trump wants to get things done. <br/><br/>He cuts deal w/Dems before GOP bruises him &amp; fails.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">GOP would have stabbed Trump in the back &amp; caved, but only after Dems, MSM spent weeks accusing Trump of politicizing Harvey aid.</p>, <p>The president\u2019s nationalist supporters now have to contend with new evidence that Trump is playing ball with Democrats on immigration policy, an issue closer to many of their hearts. On Thursday, Trump tweeted an assurance to the undocumented recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that they have <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-dreamers_us_59b157a7e4b0b5e531043651">\u201cnothing to worry about,\u201d</a> after Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)\xa0asked him to do.\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pelosi-trump-dream-act_us_59b1640be4b0354e440ff994">Pelosi has also claimed</a>\xa0that Trump promised to sign the DREAM Act if it reached his desk.\xa0</p>, <p>Assessing whether Trump and congressional Republicans suffered a tactical defeat or not, hinges largely on which party one believes the public would hold responsible for a government shutdown, how high the political price would be for that party, and whether it would be offset by longer-term gains.\xa0</p>, <p>Trump could have used his bully pulpit to pin the blame on Democrats for a forthcoming government shutdown by arguing that they were the ones refusing to accept spending cuts to reduce the debt, Brandon posited.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cIf the Democrats are going to try to support shutting the government down over their issues, then let\u2019s tell the American people that,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cThen you go to the negotiating table with higher leverage.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201c[Former President Barack] Obama used that rhetoric to grind down the GOP. Now you have the opportunity to flip that,\u201d he added.</p>, <p>If Ryan and McConnell could have insisted on the type of spending cuts that fiscal conservatives so badly crave, that would at least allow groups like FreedomWorks to show their members that a unified Republican government can lead to tangible constraints on spending and debt, according to Brandon.</p>, <p>Even if Republicans got stuck with the blame for a shutdown, it is not clear that voters\u2019 anger would last long enough to affect the party\u2019s performance in the 2018 midterm elections.</p>, <p>In 2013, Republicans forced a government shutdown when Obama refused to de-fund the Affordable Care Act. The party <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/16/government-shutdown-debt-ceiling_n_4111483.html">capitulated</a> after a few weeks with nothing to show for it but <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/16/government-shutdown-cost_n_4110818.html">$24 billion</a> in lost economic output, but a year later voters handed <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/gop-senate-control-2014_n_6104460.html">Republicans control of the Senate</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always lot of talk about the political damage from debt ceiling showdowns and government shutdowns, but the data in practice doesn\u2019t seem to show that,\u201d Kibbe said.</p>, <p>\u201cWould it be different given the devastation of these two hurricanes?\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to solve the emergency funding problem and still insist on a path to a balanced budget, but it would have to be something that the president and the Republican leadership had invested in.\u201d\xa0</p>]

Bob Menendez's Corruption Trial</h1>|[<p>WASHINGTON \u2015 An incumbent Democratic senator is on trial this week on charges of federal bribery, and his colleagues in the Senate would rather not talk about it.</p>, <p>Federal prosecutors alleged Wednesday that Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) entered into a \u201ccorrupt pact\u201d with wealthy donor and longtime friend Dr. Salomon Melgen. They said the senator received luxurious vacations abroad, flights on the Florida eye doctor\u2019s private jet and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign cash, and that none of the gifts were disclosed on Menendez\u2019s annual financial disclosure forms as required by law.</p>, <p>In return, prosecutors alleged, Menendez helped Melgen expedite visa applications so his foreign girlfriends could visit him in the U.S. They claimed in a court\xa0<a href="http://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015e-33cd-df04-a5df-b7ef52610001" target="_blank">filing</a> on Wednesday that the relationship dated back at least as far as 2006, shortly after Menendez entered the Senate.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is what bribery looks like,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Koski <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/bribery-trial-prosecutor-menendez-acted-as-personal-senator-for-rich-doctor/2017/09/06/79a5ec40-9337-11e7-89fa-bb822a46da5b_story.html?utm_term=.2db9c46d19e6" target="_blank">said</a>\xa0Wednesday as the government made its case. \u201cThese two defendants corrupted one of the most powerful offices in our country.

They are trying to focus on pressing issues, such as providing legal status to young undocumented immigrants and the tax reform debate.</p>, <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday declined to say whether he would stand by Menendez if he\u2019s proven guilty.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cSenator Menendez is issuing a spirited defense,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe all believe in the presumption of innocence in this country, and Senator Menendez is fighting very hard, and we respect that greatly.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Other Democrats were similarly hesitant to weigh in on the trial.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m a former prosecutor, so I was trained appropriately to never discuss a trial until it is completed,\u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). \u201cThat process needs to be completed before we all start weighing in politically.\u201d</p>, <p>Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) said it was \u201cnot for me to decide\u201d whether Menendez is guilty. \u201cI think we should let the legal process play out.\u201d</p>, <p>Sen. Cory Booker\xa0(D-N.J.), however, praised his colleague as a \u201cchampion\u201d for residents of the Garden State.</p>, <p>\u201cHe\u2019s innocent until proven guilty. So he is an innocent man,\u201d he said.\xa0\u201cIf he\u2019s proven guilty, I think there\u2019s going to be some serious appeals because I think there are some fundamental constitutional questions that I\u2019ve never seen in a case like this.\u201d</p>, <p>It\u2019s not yet clear how the trial will affect Menendez\u2019s ability to cast votes in Washington, a likely concern for Democrats given the packed fall legislative schedule. A federal judge <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/340865-no-menendez-trial-delay-over-docs-sentencing-judge-says" target="_blank">rejected</a> Menendez\u2019s request to delay the trial while he attended to congressional business, criticizing the senator for \u201cseeking special treatment.\u201d</p>, <p>Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to use the trial as a way to attack vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2018.\xa0The Republican National Committee launched a series of online <a href="http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/09/gop_targets_us_sen_elizabeth_w.html" target="_blank">ads</a> <span tabindex="0">this week</span>\xa0on Facebook and Twitter, urging high-profile Democrats to weigh in on the fate of Menendez.

The first is that the Department \u201cwill launch a transparent notice and comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties,\u201d including feedback from the public and educational institutions.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cNo one benefits from a system that does not have the public\u2019s trust,\u201d DeVos said, referring to the current Title IX system.\xa0</p>, <p>The second approach DeVos announced on Thursday is that the department will implement a regional reporting center model. The model would allow universities and colleges to opt in to local reporting centers that would partner with state attorneys general and law enforcement to ensure the reporting process runs fairly. \xa0</p>, <p>The Secretary of Education repeatedly discussed the rights of not only survivors of sexual assault, but also those who have been \u201cwrongly accused\u201d of sexual misconduct.</p>, <p>She allotted most of her speech to anecdotes about how the current Title IX system has failed survivors and those wrongly accused.</p>, <p>\u201cOne rape is one too many, one assault is one too many, one aggressive act of harassment is one too many, one person denied due process is one too many,\u201d DeVos told the crowd at George Mason. \u201cThis conversation may be uncomfortable, but we must have it.

The Department\u2019s guidance, which outlined survivors\u2019 rights under longstanding federal law, was a response to this urgent reality.

And the very existence of the hearing represents a milestone of sorts, although the prospects of that conversation leading to meaningful legislation this year remain slim.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last eight months, ever since <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> became president, the focus of official debate on Capitol Hill has been on whether and how to repeal Obamacare. The premise of repeal, a cause that has defined GOP politics for years, is that the 2010 health care law has been an utter failure \u2015 sticking people with unaffordable, lousy coverage while causing private insurance markets to break down completely.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday\u2019s hearing, which featured testimony from five state insurance regulators, produced a more nuanced picture \u2015 of a law that has done a lot of good while running into some severe difficulties in parts of the country. Conversation between the senators and the witnesses kept returning to a series of relatively modest policy initiatives that could shore up shaky markets where they exist. And most of the senators seemed genuinely interested in thinking about, or at least talking about, the merits of each.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the way governing is supposed to work, and it\u2019s precisely the sort of hearing that the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, </span><a href="https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=SpeechesFloorStatements&amp;id=E246D094-36E7-46CE-87BC-B9015563E175"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lamar Alexander</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Tennessee, had promised. \u201cThis hearing is about taking one small step,\u201d Alexander said in his opening statement.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it shouldn\u2019t be a hard step to take, at least in theory. The Affordable Care Act has brought the number of Americans without insurance to historic lows, in part by making comprehensive insurance coverage available to people who couldn\u2019t get it before, either because they had pre-existing conditions or couldn\u2019t afford it without the law\u2019s federal tax credits. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in many states, insurers have struggled to attract enough healthy people, whose premium dollars end up subsidizing the bills of those with serious medical problems. In response, carriers have raised premiums or abandoned markets altogether. Although millions get tax credits that insulate them from higher premiums, millions do not. A large number of counties are down to just one insurer for next year and, as of Wednesday afternoon, a number of counties in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/health-insurance-marketplaces-for-2018/" target="_blank">Virginia</a> have none \u2015 although, if recent history is indicative, an insurer will swoop in to take the business.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heading into 2017, as President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a> was leaving office, there were signs that the overall situation was finally\xa0<a href="http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/individual-insurance-market-performance-in-early-2017/" target="_blank">improving</a>, with insurers finding their way to better margins and some companies expanding operations, even as others were withdrawing. One reason for this was careful nurturing from the Obama administration and those state officials, such as California\u2019s, who were committed to making the program work well. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, instead of a president trying to make the program succeed, there\u2019s a president doing what he can to make it fail. Trump has threatened repeatedly to stop <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-obamacare-sabotage-cbo-report_us_59932d45e4b0e789a9470748">special payments</a> to insurers, promised by the law but never appropriated, that are designed to underwrite the cost of extra financial protection for low-income consumers. Insurers have responded by seeking even higher premiums for 2018. The higher premiums might not affect consumers, depending on how insurers and regulators set the increases, but the federal government would end up spending more, and it\u2019s one more sign of how antsy the carriers have become.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if that were not enough, last week the Department of Health and Human Services announced a </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-obamacare-sabotage-enrollment-cuts_us_59a87bffe4b0b5e530fd5751"><span style="font-weight: 400;">massive cut</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to advertising and outreach. Many experts fear that, without the outreach, enrollment will drop, particularly among the healthy people insurers want to attract. In other words, the cut to enrollment spending could make the system\u2019s actuarial problems worse, driving premiums even higher.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential damage of those moves and the importance of counteracting them were common refrains from the witnesses and their interlocutors at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Julie McPeak, Tennessee\u2019s insurance commissioner, called restoration of the insurance funding \u201cthe single most critical issue that you can address to help stabilize insurance markets for 2018 and potentially bring down costs.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other big idea to get attention Wednesday was a proposal to create a federal \u201c</span><a href="http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/explaining-health-care-reform-risk-adjustment-reinsurance-and-risk-corridors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinsurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201d program, similar to one that the Affordable Care Act had in place for its first three years. Reinsurance essentially reimburses insurers for their most expensive customers \u2015 say, anybody with claims that exceed $1 million in a year. It\u2019s a way of </span><a href="http://www.milliman.com/insight/2017/Reinsurance-and-high-risk-pools-Past--present--and-future-role-in-the-individual-health-insurance-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spreading those costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across a broad population, which is what insurance is designed to do, and such an initiative would almost certainly allow insurers to reduce premiums across the board.</span></p>, <p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-state-innovation-waivers_us_58e24e27e4b0ba3595966b33"><span style="font-weight: 400;">States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can take that action on their own by taking advantage of special waivers the Affordable Care Act already allows, and the commissioner from one of those states, Alaska\u2019s Lori Wing-Heier, told the panel how successful it\u2019s been. But she and other state officials want the federal government to streamline the waiver application process, and many would like Congress to put some new federal money into the program as well.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That last part is probably more than Congress is willing to do right now. Even though creating a new federal reinsurance program is a sensible idea with a history of bipartisan support, it would require appropriating money that, at least in the short term, this Republican Congress is not about to spend. Alexander made that clear, endorsing the idea in theory but repeatedly asking why the federal government, rather than the states, should devote new money to it.</span></p>, <p>Of course, passing even a narrower measure could be difficult. Alexander and the committee\u2019s ranking Democratic, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/patty-murray">Patty Murray</a> from Washington, have sketched out what such a bill would entail: making those insurer payments, at least for a little while, in exchange for giving states some new flexibility over how the law works in their states. Although it looks like Murray wants a longer duration of payments than Alexander is willing to guarantee and Alexander wants more flexibility than Murray wants to give, it\u2019s easy to imagine the two of them finding a compromise.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What\u2019s not so easy to imagine is getting agreement from the rest of the Senate, to say nothing of the House and then the president, given lingering GOP interest in repeal. As if to underscore the difficulty, Sen. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/john-mccain">John McCain</a> (R-Ariz.), whose no vote helped kill a GOP repeal effort in July, told reporters Wednesday that he would support a health care bill his best friend in Congress, Sen. </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/6/16263316/cassidy-graham-mccain-obamacare-repeal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsey Graham</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (R-S.C.), has sponsored. That bill is another effort at </span><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/cassidy-graham-would-deeply-cut-and-drastically-redistribute-health-coverage-funding"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and would almost surely leave millions without coverage.</span></p>, <p>McCain later <a href="https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/905552334440235008" target="_blank">walked back his statement</a>, saying he wasn\u2019t sure if he would support the bill and reiterating his earlier calls to write legislation through the usual committee process. And even if McCain did come around, it\u2019s not clear when Congress would take up the legislation, because it already has a packed schedule and the ability to pass health care with with just 50 votes expires Sept. 30.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Alexander also wants to act quickly because insurers have until late September to back out or potentially change rates \u2015 and he\u2019d like to reassure them on the payments before then. If there are significant portions of his caucus still entertaining the idea of repeal, getting their support for a narrow repair bill will be that much harder.</span></p>]

In July, the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law accused him of </span><a href="https://lawyerscommittee.org/press-release/lawyers-committee-civil-rights-law-files-hatch-act-complaint-kris-kobach/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violating the Hatch Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and using his position on the commission to bolster his campaign for Kansas governor.</span></p>, <p>Regardless of whether he was doing something illegal, Kobach had a conflict of interest, said Aaron Scherb, director of legislative affairs for Common Cause, another watchdog group suing the commission.</p>, <p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s unclear if Kobach is doing anything illegal, he certainly has a conflict of interest serving simultaneously as a paid contributor to a \u2018news organization\u2019 sitting on a federal commission while serving as an elected official and running for higher office,\u201d he wrote in an email.</p>, <p>The next meeting of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity is scheduled for Sept. 12 in Manchester, New Hampshire.</p>]

This is not doctrine at all,\u201d\xa0Bannon said. \u201cI totally respect the pope and I totally respect the Catholic bishops and cardinals on doctrine. This is not about doctrine. This is about the sovereignty of a nation. And in that regard, they\u2019re just another guy with an opinion.\u201d</p>, <p>Dolan called Trump\u2019s decision <a href="https://archny.org/news/statement-of-cardinal-timothy-dolan-on-the-rescinding-of-daca" target="_blank">\u201can ominous development\u201d</a> on Tuesday and pledged to support Dreamers.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is contrary to the spirit of the Bible and of our country, and a turning away from the ideals upon which our beloved country was founded,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAll of the \u2018Dreamers\u2019 who now face such uncertainty and fear, please know that the Catholic Church loves you, welcomes you, and will fight to protect your rights and your dignity.\u201d</p>, <p>The Archdiocese of New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Bannon\u2019s remarks.</p>, <p>After being ousted from the White House last month amid simmering tensions and a torrent of scandals and controversies within the Trump administration, Bannon has returned to the right-wing website Breitbart News, which he led before joining Trump\u2019s campaign last summer.</p>, <p>Bannon on Thursday defended Trump\u2019s widely condemned response to last month\u2019s violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which the president was reluctant to directly single out the white supremacist, KKK and neo-Nazi groups who incited the violence.</p>, <p>\u201cWhat he was trying to say is that people that support the monument staying there peacefully and people that oppose that, that\u2019s the normal course of First Amendment,\u201d Bannon said.</p>, <p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s talking about the neo-Nazis and neo-Confederates and the Klan, who, by the way, are absolutely awful. There\u2019s no room in American politics for that. There\u2019s no room in American society for that,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd all Donald Trump was saying is, \u2018Where does it end?

Some will keep them even longer: The Department of Homeland Security is still reviewing applications from new DACA applicants if they were submitted by Sept. 5. DHS will also renew DACA for eligible current recipients if their permits expire between Sept. 5 and March 5, but they must submit their applications by Oct. 5. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But rescinding DACA still poses a real risk for Dreamers. Some have permits that will expire after March 5, meaning they won\u2019t be able to apply to renew them. Others don\u2019t have permits yet and have not applied, and now won\u2019t be able to. Even if people are eligible to apply for renewal, it\u2019s likely some won\u2019t be able to pay the $495 fee without more time to save. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important question will be what happens to Dreamers after the six-month period if Congress and Trump don\u2019t make a deal \u2015 which is a very real possibility given the many past failures on the matter, even if lawmakers in both parties are currently insisting they want to work out a compromise to help Dreamers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House reportedly sent talking points to Capitol Hill that suggested DACA recipients should leave the country. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security urges DACA recipients to use the time remaining on their work authorizations to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States \u2015 including proactively seeking travel documentation \u2015 or to apply for other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible,\u201d the memo said, </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/05/politics/white-house-memo-daca-recipients-leave/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DHS spokesman David Lapan </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/05/politics/white-house-memo-daca-recipients-leave/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they \u201cexpect Congress to pass legislation so this will hopefully be a moot point,\u201d but always encourage undocumented individuals to depart voluntarily or try to find legal avenues to gain status. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DHS officials have said they have no plans to affirmatively go after DACA recipients in the event that they lose their permits. But many Dreamers are afraid anyway, based on other Trump policies. Trump has said immigration agents should be unleashed to do what they believe is best, and he instructed officials to revoke Obama-era guidelines of who should be pursued for deportation. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since those policies were changed, immigration advocates and attorneys said they have seen a greater number of individuals who were allowed to stay in the country for years being picked up \u2015 particularly if they have removal orders, which many DACA recipients do. Immigration and Customs Enforcement </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ice-enforcement_us_5980c7fde4b08e1430063383"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has reported large numbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of \u201ccollateral\u201d arrests of people they were not initially targeting in enforcement operations and a </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-deportation_us_591c6e55e4b0a7458fa4e191"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greater proportion of arrests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of non-criminals since Trump\u2019s inauguration compared to the same period under Obama\u2019s final year.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICE acting director Thomas Homan </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ice-arrests-undocumented_us_594027c0e4b0e84514eebfbe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in June that all undocumented immigrants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be afraid of being detained. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIf you\u2019re in this country illegally and you committed a crime by entering this country, you should be uncomfortable,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cYou should look over your shoulder, and you need to be worried.\u201d </span></p>]

The president supports that, he would sign it. But we have to get it passed.\u201d</p>, <p>Democrats are pushing for the bill, called the Dream Act, after Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program earlier this week. So-called Dreamers who received two-year work permits and deportation protections will begin to lose them in six months unless Congress steps in to act.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has said he wants to work with Congress, including Democrats, to pass a bill that addresses DACA recipients before that time. He called Pelosi earlier Thursday and made the comment about the Dream Act then, as well as in a meeting on Wednesday, according to Pelosi.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After their phone conversation, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-dreamers_us_59b157a7e4b0b5e531043651?ys">Trump tweeted to say Dreamers should not worry about being detained</a>\xa0over the next six months, which a Democratic aide said Pelosi requested he say publicly.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the conversations.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats in the House and Senate called for a vote on the Dream Act in September and said they are prepared to attach the legislation to other bills until it passes. Earlier this week, lawmakers opened up an informal restriction on co-sponsorship of the bill \u2015 they were allowing members to sign on only in Democrat-Republican pairs \u2015 and expect the number of backers to go up significantly in the House.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelosi predicted it would pass in the House if it was allowed to go for a vote. That would depend, however, on whether House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) allowed it to go for a vote. He said Wednesday that he wanted to pair Dreamer legislation with border security.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Mitchell McConnell (R-Ky.) has previously opposed the Dream Act and other immigration bills that would grant legal status to undocumented immigrants.</span></p>, <p>Pelosi said she believes Trump will demand border security measures as part of a Dream Act package, but not a wall.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday morning on the Senate floor that Trump called him earlier in the day and \u201csaid he wanted to help in the Dream Act.\u201d Schumer said that he asked Trump to push other Republicans to support the bill and Ryan and McConnell to hold a vote \u201cASAP.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe now have four Republican cosponsors. We need more,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThere are many on the floor, in the Senate, who seem to be sympathetic to the Dream Act. Maybe the president can help them get to cosponsor.\u201d</span></p>, <p>The Dream Act, first introduced in 2001, would allow certain young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. under the age of 18 to gain legal status and eventually become eligible for citizenship.\xa0</p>, <p>Republicans are also gathering support for the Recognizing America\u2019s Children, or RAC Act, a standalone bill that would allow certain young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to gain legal status. That bill would apply to a narrower population of Dreamers: only those who entered before the age of 16 would be eligible.\xa0</p>, <p>The RAC Act is picking up steam in the House. It gained <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1468/cosponsors?pageSort=lastToFirst" target="_blank">nine co-sponsors</a> on Tuesday and Wednesday, and is now up to 28 backers in total, all of them Republicans. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) is expected to introduce the RAC Act in the Senate in coming days.</p>]

Wednesday alone, this location had gone through three truckloads of plywood \u2015 with each truck carrying 20 bundles of 60 sheets apiece, one store employee said \u2015 as the city and its residents scrambled to prepare for the arrival of Irma, the storm that has already devastated Caribbean islands and is expected to turn north toward Florida.</p>, <p>De Toledo\u2019s house has impact-resistant windows, so the wood wasn\u2019t for his home. Instead, he needed it for his niece, who lives a few blocks away. Irma, one of the largest and strongest storms to ever develop over the Atlantic Ocean, will be her first hurricane.</p>, <p>Now, with the cashier in the process of swiping his card, he worried he\u2019d leave the store empty-handed. Instead, he was the last customer of the afternoon to get his hands on what had become one of South Florida\u2019s most precious commodities. Outside, after a nervous few minutes of waiting in line, he snagged the final five sheets of plywood Home Depot had, plus two broken pieces the store gave him for the price of one.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been this concerned,\u201d de Toledo said as he wheeled the sheets to his pickup truck. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to be, but it\u2019s hard.\u201d</p>, <p>Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-irma_us_59aeb3abe4b0dfaafcf2ac67?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009">has warned</a> that Hurricane Irma is \u201cbigger, faster and stronger\u201d than even Hurricane Andrew, the devastating storm that barreled into the Miami coast in 1992, causing 44 deaths and $25 billion worth of damage a quarter century ago last week. As of late Wednesday, Irma had had sustained winds of 185 miles per hour for more than 24 hours, and it remained a Category 5 storm capable of causing massive destruction across the Caribbean and into Florida.</p>, <p>Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gim\xe9nez began ordering evacuations Wednesday. The Florida Keys were under <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-irma-rick-scott_us_59b00079e4b0dfaafcf453bc">mandatory evacuation orders</a>, and Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine <a href="https://www.spot.im/s/00UghC7FQBeJ" target="_blank">pushed residents</a> of the barrier island to head toward the mainland.</p>, <p>It was an odd paradox, though, that their urgency also fostered a sense of calm as residents of Florida\u2019s Atlantic Coast communities prepared for Irma\u2019s wrath.</p>, <p>Home Depot wasn\u2019t the only store short on supplies. At a local Walmart, shelves that would normally hold pallets of bottled water, non-perishable food items and necessities such as gas cans and batteries were bare before noon Wednesday. Lines of cars stretched from gas station pumps into the streets, with wait times for the chance to fuel up lasting an hour or longer. Some stations have run out of gas.</p>, <p>But for the most part, there was little outward indication of fear or frenzy. Those in line behind de Toledo left Home Depot without fuss, vowing to return Thursday. Lines of patient Walmart shoppers waited with barely a word as employees fetched extra packages of water bottles from storage.</p>, <p>The dire warnings of Irma\u2019s strength, it seems, have succeeded in persuading Floridians to prepare for disaster well in advance of its prospective arrival, which in turn has succeeded in keeping everyone as tranquil as can be expected. If stores run out of water or gas today, it is early enough for new shipments to come in tomorrow, with at least some time to spare. It\u2019s as if everyone understands that freaking out will only make everyone\u2019s lives worse.</p>, <p>\u201cPeople are getting ready [early],\u201d de Toledo said. \u201cSo the gas stations, the stores, they have time to replenish for people to continue getting ready.\u201d</p>, <p>At times Wednesday, that sense of serenity and normality felt almost eerie.</p>, <p>On Fort Lauderdale Beach, tourists and locals alike still enjoyed a day of sun as lifeguard stands flew green flags to indicate that the ocean was calm, no matter what sort of storm loomed beyond the horizon.</p>, <p>Jim Green, who has lived here for four years, spent the early afternoon on the beach. Green rents a fourth-floor condo nearby and has a place on the Gulf Coast, too. There\u2019s still a chance Irma might swing out east into the Atlantic or turn westward toward the Gulf of Mexico. Green is waiting for Thursday\u2019s forecast to see which direction the storm might go. Only then will he decide which way he heads in response. His biggest worry is how his two cats will fare. Either way, they\u2019re going with him.</p>, <p>Kristal and Corey Davis sat a short walk down the beach, gazing out at an ocean dotted with a dozen yachts and catamarans sprinting across the water as if it were any other day. The couple vacations in Fort Lauderdale every year. They\u2019ll head home to Maryland on Saturday morning, a day earlier than planned.</p>, <p>The emptier-than-usual beaches and restaurants are \u201ca little bit more relaxing,\u201d Kristal Davis said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still tense, because you know a hurricane is coming and people are going to be impacted. \u2026 For it to impact a place that we call a second home, it is concerning to us.\u201d</p>, <p>Across the beachfront boardwalk behind them, Freddy Bousquet opened The Drunken Taco for lunch, as he has most every day for the last three years. The lunchtime crowd was small, aside from a few barflies and a table of men and women in Army fatigues. But September is always the slowest time here. Bousquet, the restaurant\u2019s general manager, lost a few employees for the weekend as they evacuated or went home to prepare for Irma\u2019s arrival, and he\u2019s still trying to determine what course he and the restaurant will take.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThursday will be the right time to know where the storm will end up going,\u201d Bousquet said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a better idea where we\u2019re going to be and what we\u2019ll need to do at that point. If Thursday they say it\u2019s coming here, we\u2019ll have to start shutting down the place.\u201d</p>, <p>But Wednesday night, the situation began to feel more desperate.\xa0The National Hurricane Center updated its projections to show that Irma could slam directly into South Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, with tropical storm-force winds that could spread across the entire state. The NHC is expected to issue a hurricane watch for Florida on Thursday, and more evacuation orders could be coming for Fort Lauderdale and beyond.</p>, <p>Many local residents seem resolved to stay and ride out the storm. As if to hammer that point home, a bar just off the beach announced a Wednesday night hurricane party with a sign that read, bluntly, \u201cFuck you, Irma. We\u2019re Floridians.\u201d</p>, <p>Scott, however, urged them not to.</p>, <p>\u201cThis storm has the potential to devastate our state,\u201d <a href="https://www.spot.im/s/00rTCZfbxKF5" target="_blank">the governor said</a> at a Wednesday evening news conference. \u201cWe have to take this seriously. ... Please do not think you can ride this storm out. Again, you can rebuild your house, you can rebuild your possessions, but you cannot rebuild your life or family.\u201d</p>, <p>Many residents who spoke to HuffPost suggested that they would likely leave if ordered to, even if they weren\u2019t sure where they might go.

Still, they are in a unique position. If they lose DACA, they would be unable to work and likely unable to fulfill their commitments to serve in the United States military. But the DOD has not yet announced how it would deal with them.</span></p>, <p>\u201cThe Department of Defense (DOD) is coordinating with the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security (DHS) regarding any impact a change in policy may have for DACA recipients,\u201d said DOD spokesperson Lt.

(Although many Dreamers speak a foreign language, the most common, Spanish, is not one of the sought after languages in the program.) Since that time, more than 10,000 non-U.S. citizens have either joined or signed contracts to join the military through the program, according to the DOD.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration </span><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/03/535342867/pentagon-considers-canceling-program-that-recruits-immigrant-soldiers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is considering cancelling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the program altogether, and it is under review for potential security risks after being suspended last September.

Non-U.S. citizens may generally advertise on issues. Other ads, such as those that mention a candidate but do not call for the candidate\u2019s election or defeat, fall into what lawyers have called a legal gray area.</p>, <p>Facebook announced the findings in a blog post by its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, and said that it was cooperating with federal inquiries into influence operations during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>, <p>Facebook briefed members of both the Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees on Wednesday about the suspected Russia advertising, according to a congressional source familiar with the matter. Both committees are conducting probes into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, including potential collusion between the campaign of President Donald Trump and Moscow.</p>, <p>Facebook also gave its findings to Robert Mueller, the special counsel in charge of investigating alleged Russian interference in last year\u2019s presidential election, a source familiar with the matter said. The company produced copies of advertisements as well as data about the buyers, the source said.</p>, <p>Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment.</p>, <p>Facebook said it found no link between the Russian-purchased advertising and any specific presidential campaign.

Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.</p>, <p>The two 4-by-6-foot windows\xa0\u201care not only inconsistent with our current mission to serve as a house of prayer for all people, but also a barrier to our important work on racial justice and racial reconciliation,\u201d church leaders\xa0<a href="https://cathedral.org/press-room/announcement-future-lee-jackson-windows/" target="_blank">wrote in a statement</a>\xa0published Wednesday on the cathedral\u2019s website. \u201cTheir association with racial oppression, human subjugation and white supremacy does not belong in the sacred fabric of this Cathedral.\u201d</p>, <p>The statement, signed by Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, the cathedral\u2019s dean, and John Donoghue, chair of the board of directors, said the decision came after two years of discussion and deliberation. The cathedral\u2019s board voted it into effect on Tuesday.</p>, <p>\u201cThere are a lot of people who have felt alienated from the cathedral because of these windows,\u201d Kevin Eckstrom, the cathedral\u2019s chief communications officer, told HuffPost on Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody to have to check their identity or their history or their beliefs at the door when they come here.\u201d</p>, <p>As a central hub for the U.S.-based Episcopal Church, the cathedral has hosted many prominent events over the years, including presidential funerals and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/01/13/washington-national-cathedrals-decision-to-participate-in-trumps-inauguration-is-creating-tension/?utm_term=.151873f72731" target="_blank">inaugural events</a>, most recently for President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>.</p>, <p>The Confederate-themed windows date back to 1953, when they were installed as a gift from the United Daughters of the Confederacy. They depict scenes from the two generals\u2019\xa0lives, as well as a representation of the Confederate battle flag.</p>, <p>The United Daughters of the Confederacy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.</p>, <p>Former cathedral dean Gary Hall had previously called for the windows\u2019 removal in 2015, after a white supremacist known to <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/dylann-roof-making-of-an-american-terrorist" target="_blank">admire Confederate symbols and history</a>\xa0killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>, <p>\u201cIn 2015, we know that celebrating the lives of these two men, and the flag under which they fought, promotes neither healing nor reconciliation, especially for our African-American sisters and brothers,\u201d Hall <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865631488/Washington-Cathedral-dean-on-Confederate-flags-6It-is-time-to-take-those-windows-out7.html" target="_blank">told Religion News Service</a> at the time.</p>, <p>In August, two days after violence erupted in\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/during-racist-charlottesville-rally-car-plows-into-crowd-of-people_us_598f422fe4b09071f69a019e">Charlottesville, Virginia</a>,\xa0as white supremacists rallied against the removal of a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Hall <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gary.hall.1949/posts/1569087043111568?pnref=story" target="_blank">reposted his earlier call</a>\xa0on Facebook, commenting: \u201cJust sayin\u2019.\u201d</p>, <p>Responding to a critic who suggested the windows\u2019 removal would be akin to removing the face of slave-owning presidents from Mount Rushmore \u2015 an argument Trump has\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-confederate-monuments_us_59959586e4b06ef724d6c37a">also made</a> \u2015 Hall wrote:</p>, <p>\u201cThese monuments were designed and paid for by the United Daughters of the Confederacy in the 1950s to rebrand the confederacy and distract from the issue of slavery and civil rights. They are not innocent.\u201d</p>, <p>Eckstrom also addressed the question of historical erasure, saying: \u201cOne of the common misunderstandings is that we\u2019ll take the windows down and either throw them away or give them away. Actually we\u2019re planning on preserving them and returning them to the cathedral in some way in a non-sacred place so they can have a second life as an educational tool.\u201d</p>, <p>Cathedral leaders said they will deliberate further to determine what will replace the windows.</p>, <p>Surveys have found that Americans are generally unsupportive of attempts to remove memorials honoring Confederate leaders. One\xa0<a data-beacon-parsed="true" href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/tabsHPConfederateFlag20170815.pdf">HuffPost/YouGov poll</a>\xa0conducted in August found that one-third of Americans favor removing statues and memorials of Confederate leaders, with 49 percent opposed. Just 29 percent of Americans favor changing the names of streets, schools and buildings commemorating Confederate leaders, while half are opposed. Responses to similar surveys varied, based on <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/confederate-statues-removal-polls_us_599de056e4b05710aa59841c">how the question was asked</a> and what different options were provided.</p>, <p>Several states, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/states-confederate-statue-laws_us_5996312be4b0e8cc855cb2ab">including North Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi</a>, have laws on the books that make it particularly difficult to remove symbols of the Confederacy. In other places, local officials have <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baltimore-confederate-statues_us_5994274fe4b009141641806b">worked swiftly to remove Confederate monuments</a> without drawing attention from white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups.</p>, <p>With memories of the violence in Charlottesville still fresh, Eckstrom said the cathedral\u2019s windows will be removed judiciously in a process that may take several days.</p>, <p>\u201cSafety is a big concern for us, and it has been throughout this process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do this in as dignified and safe a way as possible. We don\u2019t really know what to expect, but have tried to plan for a number of scenarios.\u201d</p>, <p>Removing the windows is a symbolic action that will hopefully underscore ongoing racial justice efforts, Eckstrom added, reiterating the cathedral\u2019s official statement.</p>, <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about windows here,\u201d Eckstrom said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about racial justice and the legacy of slavery and the role of the church in that. After the windows are gone, we\u2019re hoping to rally the attention around the harder work of racial reconciliation.\u201d</p>]

She grew up not knowing that she was undocumented until the milestones of adolescence \u2014 travel, driving, college, work \u2014 were suddenly out of reach.\xa0</p>, <p>Once she understood that she could be deported at any time, Ilagan kept to herself. When her mother died in 2006, she stayed close to home, socializing with only her childhood friends. Meeting new people was too risky, she said, because there was no way to gauge how they felt about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/immigration">undocumented immigrants</a>. She feared that every new acquaintance could be the one to finally turn her in.</p>, <p>\u201cI was really insecure about my future,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no say. I had no plans. It was really frustrating.\u201d</p>, <p>Immigration policy generally affects health in two ways: materially and psychologically. Immigration laws can either give or deny people job permits and driver\u2019s licenses, which in turn can determine a person\u2019s earning power, ability to get health insurance and access to health care. Psychologically, immigrants who are undocumented can feel stress, anxiety and depression, which can in turn affect everything from their cardiovascular health to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sharing-the-same-ethnicity-as-people-targeted-in-immigration-policy-can-be-harmful-for-your-health_us_58910b15e4b0c90eff00def0">birthweight of their babies</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWhile we\u2019re making decisions about immigration policy, we\u2019re talking about constitutionality, the effects on the economy and demographics,\u201d said Aresha Martinez-Cardoso, a public health researcher at the University of Michigan. \u201cBut we also need to talk about the health consequences of immigration policy.\u201d</p>, <p>The research on DACA is clear: Once the program <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-marks-fifth-anniversary-amid-looming-legal-threat_us_59920a88e4b0909642993a00">went into effect in 2012</a>, there were immediate physical and mental health benefits, not only for the immigrants themselves but also for their family members who were U.S. citizens.\xa0</p>, <p>Immigration researchers found a measurable <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318760" target="_blank">improvement in psychological wellness</a> among those who benefited from DACA. DACA-eligible immigrants also had improved access to health care, which in turn <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28359735" target="_blank">improved mental health</a> and a sense of well-being among these young adults.\xa0Even the children of DACA-eligible recipients benefited and experienced lower rates of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-has-profound-mental-health-benefits-for-children-of-dreamers_us_59a835d1e4b07e81d355f33d">anxiety and adjustment disorder</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>DACA also had an immediate effect on acute, stress-induced medical conditions common among the undocumented: headaches, toothaches, ulcers, sleep problems and eating disorders, said Roberto Gonzales, a professor at Harvard University Graduate School of Education.</p>, <p>\u201c<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520287266" target="_blank">In our DACA work</a>, we have found that lessened fear and anxiety reduced many of these physical and emotional manifestations of stress,\u201d said Gonzales, who studies factors that hinder immigrant and Latino education.\xa0</p>, <p>For Ilagan, DACA helped bring the confidence and self-assurance that comes with freedom from the threat of deportation. She was able to work legally, which helped her catapult from under-the-table nanny jobs to assistant director at a preschool. She is currently finishing her bachelor\u2019s degree and working on her elementary school teaching credential while she works. And, crucially, DACA helped her realize she wasn\u2019t alone.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWhen DACA came into play, I was able to talk about it more and say,\xa0\u2018Oh, there are other people in my situation. It isn\u2019t just me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a whole network and a whole slew of other people going through the exact same thing I\u2019ve gone through\xa0\u2014 the exact same emotional heartache.\u201d</p>, <p>U.S. Attorney General <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/jeff-sessions">Jeff Sessions</a> announced Tuesday that the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/trump-administration/">Trump administration</a> was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b">terminating the DACA program</a>, and, barring new legislation, it would end in six months.</p>, <p>When it ends, so too will the health improvements immigrants experienced after its 2012 inception, experts say. And if a new law isn\u2019t put in place to prevent deportations, the 800,000 so-called Dreamers who benefited from DACA are at risk of becoming refugees in their supposed countries of origin \u2015 a status often accompanied by health problems including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and other mental health issues.\xa0</p>, <p>Martinez-Cardoso said that public health researchers suspect that those problems will arise again among DACA beneficiaries as they face its loss and among the \u201cfamily members and friends who are also helping to support the DACA-eligible youth.\u201d</p>, <p>In fact, DACA recipients may face an even greater sense of loss because of all they\u2019ve gained since the program began.</p>, <p>\u201cThese kids and young adults have things like jobs, car notes, house mortgages, apartment leases,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now they have to think about all those things being taken away from them.\u201d</p>, <p>Dreamers who applied for DACA protection implicitly trusted the federal government with their personal identifying information, addresses and other details that would now make rounding them up for deportation easier than if they had never applied.\xa0</p>, <p>If the U.S. government can\u2019t come up with a legislative solution for the approximately 800,000 people enrolled in DACA and instead moves forward with the mass deportation of immigrants who grew up in America and know no other homeland, they could be complicit in creating an unprecedented kind of refugee, says Dr. Patrick Marius Koga, director of refugee health research at the University of California, Davis, medical school.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThey will become reverse refugees, because they\u2019ve already adjusted to our country \u2014 it\u2019s their country as well,\u201d said Koga. \u201cIt\u2019s a new sort of refugee, almost unheard of before.\u201d</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>The only other comparable migration in modern memory is the supposed \u201cvoluntary\u201d return of Afghan migrants from Pakistan, said Koga. By the end of 2016, the Pakistan government\u2019s increasing refugee crackdowns and tensions between the two countries led to the migration of more than 600,000 Afghan migrants from Pakistan back to Afghanistan \u2015 even though many of them had lived in Pakistan for decades and were well-integrated into the society.</p>, <p>While it\u2019s too soon to know the full scope of this forced migration\u2019s effect on Afghan refugee health, experts fear that they will have <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/02/13/pakistan-coercion-un-complicity/mass-forced-return-afghan-refugees" target="_blank">less access to care</a> back in their home country and may be at a <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/02/afghan-refugee-crisis-2016" target="_blank">heightened risk of recruitment</a> into criminal and extremist organizations.</p>, <p>\u201cYou can imagine the humanitarian damage and crisis this has created,\u201d Koga said of the Pakistan-Afghanistan migration. \u201cBut this is going to top that one. If 800,000 people are forced to leave this country, there is going to be a humanitarian crisis and lots of emotional damage.\u201d</p>, <p>America\u2019s medical professionals should prepare to respond humanely and professionally to the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers who could soon undergo a similar forced migration, he said.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThat kind of rupture of young people from America is going to be extremely difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical and public health community should think of the baggage of this humanitarian catastrophe and think of interventions of mental support.\u201d</p>, <p>Koga said that he and others in the medical and refugee research community were still in shock over Tuesday\u2019s DACA announcement, and he was in despair over the uncertain fate of the Dreamers.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cMassive public health education, coaching and skill building [to cope] with anger, disappointment, fear and anxiety: How do we deliver that within six months to such a large population?\u201d\xa0</p>, <p><em>CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, professor Roberto Gonzales was referred to as an assistant professor in an earlier version of this article.</em></p>]

But is it really?</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the November election, the majority of the publishing world \u2015 a mostly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/27/us-study-finds-publishing-is-overwhelmingly-white-and-female" target="_blank">white</a>, mostly <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/73292-is-book-publishing-too-liberal.html" target="_blank">liberal</a> crowd \u2015 has been reeling, and not just because the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> presidency goes against the vaunted egalitarian principles of intellectual tastemakers. In <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/144029/trump-ruining-book-sales" target="_blank">The New Republic</a> recently, Morgan Jerkins reported that many authors, editors and booksellers have noticed a significant slump in the market, which many blame on the current administration. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe disastrous and almost comically incompetent Trump presidency has both frightened the reading market away from popular books and functioned as a kind of mass entertainment with which it is difficult to compete,\u201d she wrote.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what are readers actually experiencing? Are they reading less and spending more time on activism? According to a new <a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/tabsHPReadingTime20170814.pdf">HuffPost/YouGov poll</a>, the answer to that is complicated, but it suggests that Trump\u2019s rise has done little to substantially shift the habits of readers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though 21 percent of respondents said they spent less time reading books in 2016 and 2017 than in past years, 18 percent said they\u2019d spent </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time reading books \u2015 and 41 percent spent about the same time as in previous years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Notably, black respondents were the most likely demographic group to report having read less in the past two years \u2015 32 percent, compared to 20 percent of white and Hispanic respondents, 21 percent of men and 24 percent of women.)\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who read less were significantly more likely to attribute it to having less free time or to stress rather than prioritizing political activism; only 9 percent said political engagement was a factor in reducing their reading time.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales data from 2016 adds to this picture of a fairly stable publishing industry. According to </span><a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/72450-print-book-sales-rose-again-in-2016.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publishers Weekly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, print sales edged up last year, and while adult fiction sales took a 1 percent dip, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/9-great-young-adult-novels-for-politically-engaged-readers_us_58ee82fde4b0da2ff85db903">juvenile fiction</a> surged by 3.8 percent. That 3.8 percent boost was driven by a Y.A. book certainly purchased in bulk by adult readers: the script of J.K. Rowling\u2019s \u201c<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-you-should-know-about-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-before-its-release_us_579a0cd5e4b02d5d5ed47f60">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts 1 and 2</a>.\u201d PW also noted that adult nonfiction rocketed up by 6.9 percent, specifically thanks to \u201ccrafts and hobbies, where the adult coloring book boom \u2015 though slowing down from 2015\u2019s blitz \u2015 continues to have a large impact,\u201d along with religious and self-help texts.</span></p>, <p>Miriam Sontz, CEO of Powell\u2019s Books, a popular independent bookstore chain in and around Portland, Oregon, told HuffPost that the store did notice a lull in the immediate time frame of the election, from the beginning of September to mid-November. \u201cThe news, whether you thought it was good or bad, dominated the landscape and didn\u2019t lead people to our shelves,\u201d she said. But the idea of an ongoing slump didn\u2019t ring true to her. \u201cSince then,\u201d she told HuffPost, \u201csales have returned to reasonable levels and even increased in some areas.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, several industry professionals reported to The New Republic a shift in readers\u2019 tastes, if not the volume of reading. Booksellers and publishers have noticed a burst in popularity for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dystopias-to-read-right-n_us_588f7f3de4b0c90efefef03a">classic dystopias</a>, and a renewed interest in political <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nonfiction-books-from-2016-that-will-expand-your-mind_us_584ef13ce4b0bd9c3dfdd647">nonfiction</a> or books by authors from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/under-trump-muslim-book-publishers-are-fighting-against-hate_us_58d3dc9be4b02d33b7492887">marginalized groups</a> \u2015 titles relevant, in other words, to the current political situation \u2015 and so have critics. This makes a lot of sense; one literary agent pointed out that authors keep getting bumped from morning TV shows to make space for political firestorms, and authors have complained, understandably, that it feels gauche or unwelcome to promote their work in such a climate. Books like <em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-orwellian-books-about-censorship-and-the-power-of-words_us_588a73ade4b0cef5cf87010f">1984</a></em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0or <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ta-nehisi-coates-between-the-world-and-me-apollo-theater_us_5902187fe4b0026db1df32db">Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 </a></span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ta-nehisi-coates-between-the-world-and-me-apollo-theater_us_5902187fe4b0026db1df32db"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the World and Me</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on the other hand, have been eagerly pushed by tastemakers (and publications like HuffPost) looking to prove how literature can aid in our understanding of a challenging political era.\xa0</span></p>, <p>Sontz agreed with the proposition that demands have shifted between genres \u2015 though not always in the expected areas. Poetry, she said, has seen a marked sales increase at Powells, as have self-help books. Overall, she told HuffPost, \u201cPeople read what brings them comfort... and if that is a science fiction series, or a political biography, or a memoir, they are reaching for the familiar and comfortable.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a whole, it\u2019s unclear whether politics have shifted how most Americans are really choosing their books. The YouGov poll offered little support for the claim that readers are choosing politically-geared nonfiction over more frivolous options, for example. While 12 percent of respondents said they\u2019d read more political essays or political science, 13 percent said they\u2019d read less. And though publicist Kima Jones pointed out, in The New Republic, that writers of color have been particularly visible and successful in this market, 46 percent of respondents reported </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">never</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reading books by authors from marginalized groups, including communities of color, and just 6 percent reported increasing such reading since 2016 began. Nine percent reported reading fewer books by authors of color and other marginalized groups.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digging past the top line of results, significant racial, gender and political differences appeared in responses to the latter question. Fifty-two percent of men, 50 percent of white respondents and 68 percent of Republicans reported never reading books by authors from traditionally marginalized groups, compared to 41 percent of women, 37 percent of black respondents, 32 percent of Hispanic respondents and 38 percent of Democrats. While breakout authors of color have enjoyed critical and sales success in the past few years, as Jones noted, the readership of such books appears to come predominantly from more traditionally progressive demographics \u2015 most likely readers who are already sympathetic to the experiences and ideas of the authors. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be sure, a sea change may have begun building in 2016, but only grown to full strength by 2017. And self-reported behavior can be dicey; readers may fail to recognize shifts in their own behavior, while those who work with large communities of readers easily pick up on the trends. Of respondents who read less in the past two years, 19 percent cited not having \u201cseen as many books that I find interesting\u201d as a factor; if authors are getting bumped from publicity appearances and book review column inches, that may be affecting how likely readers are to hear about new books they\u2019d find interesting.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, it\u2019s also tempting for people within the industry to attribute the underperformance of specific books to the distracted cultural climate, when some books have always underperformed the initial expectations.\xa0Alana Massey, whose book came out in February, said to Jerkins that she \u201cwas told that it just came out at a really bad time... I was sort of jokingly told that any books that weren\u2019t political, dystopian, or both, weren\u2019t really selling.\u201d Maybe so \u2015 but it also might be easy for publishers to offer that explanation up to soften disappointment.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authors, publishers and booksellers are constantly reading the tea leaves to decipher how much the reading public feels like reading, and whether they\u2019re currently jonesing for a dystopia or a memoir or a romance. Promoting major books involves getting them into a news cycle that is currently consumed with Trump, and so industry professionals are unquestionably forced to ask how to make their products seem relevant. This means a book like <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/yale-law-school-inequality_us_5772a27ee4b0dbb1bbbc11b9">J.D. Vance\u2019s <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></a>, as Jerkins pointed out in TNR, can garner a big publicity bump, while a less timely book might wither.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this doesn\u2019t mean publishing as a whole will implode, or even that certain genres will disappear. There\u2019s a strong possibility that, overall, readers who love romance will continue to read romance, and that thriller lovers will continue to read thrillers, regardless of what\u2019s on the news. \u201cI don\u2019t believe any president has this kind of impact on book buying,\u201d Sontz told HuffPost. \u201cNow Oprah... that\u2019s a different story.\u201d</span></p>, <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Aug. 14-15 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.</span></em></p>, <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.</span></em><a href="http://today.yougov.com/huffpost/"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can learn more</span></em></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">about this project and</span></em><a href="https://today.yougov.com/account/register/"> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">take part</span></em></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in YouGov\u2019s nationally representative opinion polling.

First with 2016\u2032s\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-lgbt-discrimination_us_56f2b7dbe4b0c3ef5217676c">House Bill 2</a> and now <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-hb2-repeal_us_58dd005be4b05eae031d72a3">House Bill 142</a>, North Carolina helped galvanize a wave of proposed legislation that has swept the American South, targeting transgender individuals and challenging their right to exist in public spaces.</p>, <p>For Emma and her family, this fight has become tangible and all-consuming over the past year.</p>, <p>Amy and Kevin Smith live in a modest home in a small community outside of historically liberal Asheville, North Carolina with their three children and a menagerie of pets. In 2014, Emma, their youngest child, who was assigned male at birth, began gravitating towards toys and clothing traditionally understood for girls.</p>, <p>\u201cShe always had girl tendencies,\u201d Kevin told HuffPost. \u201cShe\u2019s always been petite, she\u2019s aways been sweet like a little girl. Before we ever realized, she was always wanting pink and girls\u2019 toys, dolls. We didn\u2019t really know what was going on with it, we just thought, \u2018Pink, blue, what makes a difference? We don\u2019t care.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>For a few years, the parents thought Emma\u2019s preference for girls\u2019 toys and clothing might just be a phase. But as time passed and Emma began trying to articulate her understanding of the world around her, it became clear that something was different about Emma from her two older brothers.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cShe began calling me \u2018he,\u2019\u201d Amy said. \u201cWe thought she was just really confused and we needed to explain to her the difference in gender. I said, \u2018Let\u2019s explain this: Boys\u2019 pronouns are he and him. Girls\u2019 are she and her.\u2019 But Emma kept saying, \u2018You\u2019re he!\u2019</p>, <p>And then one day she said, \u201cWell, if I\u2019m a boy, you\u2019re a boy.\u201d</p>, <p>In other words: if that is what I am, then you must be it, too.</p>, <p>What followed was an intense period of self-education by Kevin and Amy \u2015 nights spent researching and purchasing books on Amazon, hours spent scouring Facebook for support groups to join. \u201cI think that we just got online to make sure that we weren\u2019t going to damage her and that we were doing things right,\u201d Amy said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we started seeing that she could be transgender.\u201d</p>, <p>The Smiths learned that being trans at Emma\u2019s age doesn\u2019t involve taking hormones or medical intervention, but coming to understand herself and her relationship with the world around her, the way every child does.</p>, <p>The family grew alongside Emma, allowing her burgeoning sense of self to shape how they related to her. It was important to the Smiths to avoid inscribing upon Emma their own thoughts and feelings about her gender.</p>, <p>\u201cWe were confused [at first] \u2015 but she\u2019s never been confused,\u201d Amy said. \u201cIt was gradual, it wasn\u2019t all of a sudden. We kept letting her express herself the way she wanted to express herself.\u201d</p>, <p>And life seemed to be ideal \u2015 almost perfect \u2015 until Emma and her brother, Miller, who is one year older, began kindergarten at their local public elementary school, Glen Arden.</p>, <p>Emma entered her first day of kindergarten at Glen Arden Elementary in August 2016 wearing a white dress with flower embroidery that she picked out herself.</p>, <p>Amy and Kevin thought that if they simply told Glen Arden educators about Emma\u2019s personal journey with gender and identity, they\u2019d be met with support and understanding. But, according to the couple, Emma faced immediate resistance.</p>, <p>\u201cIt just turned into a mess,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t [call her Emma], they refused to do it, the teachers wouldn\u2019t do it. So we had to get a meeting with the principal and formally tell them, \u2018Her name is going to be Emma.\u2019 But the teacher she was with from day one disagreed with it, and expressed her feelings to Emma daily. Emma would say she had girl hair and the teacher would tell her, \u2018No, you\u2019ve got boy hair. You\u2019re a boy.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>Kevin and Amy sat down with the Glen Arden principal to explain that their child was mid-transition, currently considered gender-nonconforming and unsure of pronouns, and that their family was still in the process of coming to understand her identity.</p>, <p>The pair say that what they found was a school under-equipped to deal with issues of gender, projected through the lens of cultural prejudice and framed by the political climate of North Carolina.</p>, <p>HuffPost reached out to Glen Arden Elementary and the Buncombe County School System and asked them to comment on these allegations. Stacia Harris, Director of Communications for Buncombe County Schools, responded with this statement:</p>, <p>Federal law prevents us from publicly discussing the specifics of any student matter. We can say that the Buncombe County School system works to ensure that all students, employees, and visitors feel safe, welcomed, and respected in all of our facilities. Our teachers, administrators, and parents work diligently to address sensitive student issues that are brought to our attention on a case-by-case basis, including issues that are related to transgender students. Individual needs and privacy concerns vary from student to student and we work to accommodate those needs so our students can focus on learning.\xa0</p>, <p>But according to the Smiths, from the very first meeting with the principal, it was evident that things were not going to be easy for their family.</p>, <p>\u201cThe principal said, \u2018Exactly who buys his clothes?\u2019 I said, \u2018Of course we do. We\u2019re his parents, we\u2019re going to buy his clothes. We buy all of our kids clothes,\u2019\u201d Amy, who at the time was using male and female pronouns interchangeably to describe Emma, told HuffPost. \u201d[The principal responded with], \u2018You know that you can tell your child to not wear these kind of clothes? He could wear boy clothes,\u2019 and just going on and on.\u201d</p>, <p>The conversation eventually turned to bathrooms \u2015 and the principal brought up House Bill 2.</p>, <p>\u2033\u2018We have to follow HB 2,\u2018\u201d the principal allegedly stated, according to Amy and Kevin. \u201cAnd that states... she has to use the boys\u2019 bathroom. And that\u2019s all we can offer.\u2019\u201d\xa0\xa0</p>, <p>The North Carolina General Assembly passed House Bill 2 in 2016 during a special session and<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-lgbt-discrimination_us_56f2b7dbe4b0c3ef5217676c"> Former Governor Pat McCroy signed it into law.</a>\xa0In addition to blocking cites and counties from passing LGBTQ anti-discrimination policies, the bill forced trans people to use public restrooms that correspond with the gender they were assigned at birth.</p>, <p>The Tar Heel state faced<a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article134822519.html" target="_blank"> enormous cultural backlash</a> for HB 2, resulting in <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/how-north-carolinas-bathroom-law-sparked-a-business-backlash/" target="_blank">massive financial loss</a> for the state and McCroy losing his governorship. Current Democratic Governor Roy Cooper<a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article125142739.html" target="_blank">\xa0ran on a platform of repealing HB 2</a>, but instead ushered in \u201ccompromise\u201d HB 142, legislation that essentially<strong>\xa0</strong><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-hb2-repeal_us_58dd005be4b05eae031d72a3">allows anti-trans discrimination</a> enabled by HB 2 to flourish.</p>, <p>\u201cNothing has changed whatsoever so it\u2019s really hard when it\u2019s been touted on such a public level that it\u2019s a repeal,\u201d Zeke Christopoulos, director and founder of Western North Carolina transgender advocacy organization <a href="http://tranzmission.org/index.html" target="_blank">Tranzmission</a>, told HuffPost. \u201cIt just leaves people\u2019s civil rights flapping in the wind. To have delayed passing on discrimination ordinances to December of 2020 \u2015 this is civil rights! How can you delay it? It\u2019s just morally repugnant. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p>, <p>Discrimination against transgender students in the North Carolina public school system is just one effect of HB 2 \u2015 but it\u2019s an insidious function that provided a framework for similar \u201cbathroom bills\u201d in other states like <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mississippi-religious-freedom-bill_us_5703f13ce4b083f5c6090dfb">Mississippi </a>and<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-senate-bathroom-bill_us_59779857e4b0c95f375f513c"> Texas</a>.</p>, <p>Activists say both HB 2 and HB 142 prevent students from feeling safe at school and receiving an education because the legislation creates a climate of harassment, bullying and humiliation by both students and teachers. The Smiths say Emma experienced this firsthand during her year in kindergarten at Glen Arden Elementary.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cSeveral times she came home crying over the teacher telling her about being a boy,\u201d Kevin told HuffPost. \u201cAnd they actually punished her for telling them that she was a girl.\u201d</p>, <p>Students in Emma\u2019s kindergarten class were assigned clips on a chart to indicate how they\u2019re behaving while at school, sort of like a sticker system.\xa0Good behavior was rewarded with the clip moving up the chart\xa0\u2015 bad with it moving down.</p>, <p>\u201cShe would come home devastated that her clip was moved down,\u201d Amy told HuffPost. \u201cWe would say, \u2018Why did your clip get moved down? What happened?\u2019 [and she responded] \u2018I said that I was a girl...\xa0and [the teacher] said that I was a boy and that if I say I\u2019m a girl again, she\u2019s going to move my clip down.\u2019... We felt like we were in a movie \u2015 like we\u2019re watching one of those Lifetime films. This can\u2019t be real. This can\u2019t be happening.\u201d</p>, <p>The Smiths talked about other moments when they felt Emma was being unfairly punished. They claim their daughter was told she had to be a pilgrim boy in the Thanksgiving play, when all other students were given a choice about which character they would play.</p>, <p>There was the \u201cnew rule\u201d that Emma was no longer allowed to hug any of her friends at Glen Arden \u2015 a rule the Smiths maintain only applied to Emma. \u201cThe only thing I can think of is a concerned parent called the school thinking that transgender [identity] was contagious or some such bullshit,\u201d Amy said.</p>, <p>Amy and Kevin say Emma\u2019s \u201cAll About Me Day\u201d was also particularly traumatic. Each student gets their own day where the teacher draws an image of the student in front of the class and their classmates follow suit.</p>, <p>Emma was ecstatic for her \u201cAll About Me Day\u201d and picked out a pink shirt with a glitter heart and a pair of little pastel shorts for the occasion.</p>, <p>She came home that afternoon bawling. Not only had the teacher written her \u201cboy name\u201d on the \u201cAbout Me\u201d image \u2015 she had erased all aspects of femininity from Emma\u2019s appearance, with all of her classmates then following the teacher\u2019s lead.</p>, <p>For Amy and Kevin, \u201cAll About Me Day\u201d was the last straw \u2015 and they had Emma moved to a different classroom in November 2016, one week after the incident.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way that that [\u201cAbout Me\u201d image] was her,\u201d Amy said. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve seen her and what she was wearing, it was \u2015 I don\u2019t know who that is. Completely different child... It was just this non-stop, emotional rollercoaster, every day. What\u2019s going to happen today?\u201d</p>, <p>Emma\u2019s new teacher respected her chosen name and pronouns. But the Smiths\u2019 nightmare was far from over. The issues Emma faced then became magnified through the lens of HB 2 when she found herself in situations where she was unable to reach the school\u2019s assigned single-stall bathrooms.</p>, <p>Emma urinated on herself on two different occasions during the remainder of the school year.</p>, <p>Whenever she needed to use the bathroom during her year at Glen Arden, Emma had three options: use a single-stall facility if one was in close proximity, use the boys\u2019 restroom, or hold it. She was not allowed to use the girls\u2019 room.</p>, <p>The first time Emma urinated on herself was during gym class. According to Amy and Kevin, she came home with a bag of soaking wet clothes and said the gym teacher told her that with no single-stall bathroom nearby, she had to either use the boys\u2019 bathroom or \u201chold it.\u201d</p>, <p>\u2033[We were] very mad, just upset,\u201d Amy recalled. \u201cWhere do you have to be in your mind to be forced to urinate on yourself or go in the boy\u2019s bathroom? What kind of choice is that for a child?\u201d</p>, <p>The second time took place during lunch.\xa0Emma was in the cafeteria and had to use the bathroom. There were single-stall restrooms located in the cafeteria.</p>, <p>But they were locked.</p>, <p>Emma told her parents that she was not allowed to leave the cafeteria and a teacher told her to \u201chold it.\u201d Sitting in the middle of a crowded lunchroom with a locked single-stall bathroom only twenty feet away, Emma urinated on herself again.</p>, <p>When Amy visited the school a week later to have lunch with her daughter, the single-stall bathrooms in the cafeteria were still locked.</p>, <p>After this second incident, Tranzmission became intimately involved in Emma\u2019s fight with the Buncombe County School System. Amy put a plea for help on a local Facebook page and eventually was connected with the organization and Christopoulos. He reassured her that the school was in the wrong and promised to help however they could.</p>, <p>\u201cThe school locked\xa0[the bathrooms] so Emma couldn\u2019t use them,\u201d Christopoulos, Director of Tranzmission, told HuffPost. \u201cI will say, and this is pretty personal, that as a kid I did pee on myself in school because I didn\u2019t want to go to the bathroom because I didn\u2019t want to be seen going into the girls\u2019 room. Emma\u2019s having that forced on her. She\u2019s been in the girls\u2019 room. She\u2019s used it. She feels comfortable with that. She doesn\u2019t want to go in the boys\u2019 room and she\u2019s being forced to.\u201d</p>, <p>Other organizers and activists involved with Tranzmission also view Emma\u2019s fight as highly personal. Allison Scott, Advocacy Director for Tranzmission, told HuffPost that she sees much of herself as a child in Emma \u2015 and that the Smith\u2019s story sounds just like countless others as families with trans and gender-nonconforming children all over the country are fighting for their kids\u2019 rights.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is the thing that makes Amy and Emma and Kevin and their family, what they\u2019re going through, so wonderful and so painful at the same time,\u201d Scott told HuffPost. \u201cMost families [with transgender children] have not pushed it publicly, have not pushed it this far because they don\u2019t want the hate. They don\u2019t want the blowback from their community, from their family, from their friends, from schools... This is why so many kids are going through this silently. For every Emma out there, there are ten Emmas and there are ten trans boys and there are ten gender-nonconforming kids who are not fighting. Not because they\u2019re weak, not because they don\u2019t want it, just because the blowback is too much for them to handle.\u201d</p>, <p>The school year ended not long after the second urination incident \u2015 but the Smiths and Tranzmission were only getting started. In the months since, they\u2019ve organized protests, attended board meetings and shored up community support <a href="http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/05/20/discovering-emma-kindergartners-transgender-journey/99975676/" target="_blank">through local media </a>in an attempt to have the Buncombe County School System adopt a policy that provides institutional support for trans and gender-nonconforming children \u2015 including letting them use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.</p>, <p>\u201cI think that basically establishing a policy that all kids are safe and all kids are<br/>valued is primary,\u201d Christopoulos told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about being trans or non-binary, but it\u2019s about every kid deserving education that doesn\u2019t have discrimination at its heart. We have public school for a reason. It\u2019s so that all kids can receive the same tools and have the same opportunities. When you\u2019re discriminating against any class, it\u2019s oppressing them. It\u2019s oppressing their chance for the future and it does grave emotional harm.\u201d</p>, <p>Amy and Kevin are also committed to pressuring the school board to adopt a policy ensuring the safety and quality of life for kids like Emma \u2015 despite the fact that they chose to transfer Emma to a charter school for the Fall 2017 semester.\xa0</p>, <p>This decision to have Emma leave Glen Arden rather than returning for first grade alongside her brother was extremely difficult. But Amy and Kevin felt the most important thing was ensuring Emma\u2019s well-being \u2015 and the pair will continue to fight for other families like their own.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be at every meeting and I\u2019m still going to try to get a policy in place,\u201d Amy told HuffPost. \u201cThey\u2019ve already agreed to do training for the teachers so that\u2019s one positive\u2026 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to describe. At first I felt like I\u2019d been beaten and then after I step back and look at it I realize that I don\u2019t think there is any chance they would ever do that to another child in that school because of what we did. I guarantee you they are going to put some kind of training in place, or at least the next parent that comes in and tells that principal \u2018my child is exploring gender\u2019 \u2013 they won\u2019t ever think of saying \u2018well don\u2019t you buy his clothes?\u2019 We made a mark.\u201d</p>, <p>As for Emma, she couldn\u2019t be happier at her new school\xa0\u2015\xa0an educational institution where she is allowed to not only wear her favorite dresses without scrutiny and tell her classmates that her name is Emma \u2015 but where she will never have to worry about which bathroom to use ever again.</p>, <p>\u201cI go pick her up and she\u2019s smiling, it\u2019s just night and day different. She\u2019s a different child,\u201d Amy continued. \u201cHer teacher keeps saying \u2018she keeps hugging me! Like she hugs me 20 times a day!\u2019 and she couldn\u2019t even look her other teachers in the eye. I mean literally, she would not look them in the eye \u2013 she wouldn\u2019t look them in the face. She\u2019s just so incredibly happy.\u201d</p>, <p><em>If you would like more information about Tranzmission and how you can help support their fight for children and people like Emma living in Western North Carolina,\xa0<a href="http://tranzmission.org/index.html" target="_blank">head here</a>.</em></p>]

Some want to cut it all the way to 15 percent, while others would prioritize allowing immediate write-offs for business expenses, rather than having them claimed as deductions over a period of years, he said.</p>, <p>\u201cOther debates are what cuts are made temporary -\u2013 10 years or less -\u2013 or permanent,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>There is a consensus, Norquist said, to eliminate the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax. And there\u2019s a desire to end the deduction for state and local tax payments to pay for cutting rates for individuals.</p>, <p>The alternative minimum tax applies only to wealthier taxpayers who itemize a lot of deductions. The estate tax \u2013 or \u201cdeath tax,\u201d as Norquist and other Republicans like to call it \u2013 affects only those Americans who are handing down inheritances worth at least $5.5 million.</p>, <p>Ending the state and local deduction would hit residents of high-tax states the hardest, like those in the northeast and California.</p>, <p>But Norquist said it would win support because the lower corporate rate would be available to the self-employed and to small-business owners who currently pay those taxes on their individual returns. \u201cThirty million entrepreneurs are a political army,\u201d he said. \u201cThey vote.\u201d</p>, <p>Whatever the eventual makeup of the proposal, it may wind up lasting only 10 years, because Senate procedure prohibits any bill passed under special \u201creconciliation\u201d rules to last longer than a decade if it increases the budget deficit. The reconciliation process allows Senate Republicans to pass tax cuts with a simple majority. The normal process requires 60 votes, which means Republican leaders would need to persuade at least 8 Democrats to back the tax plan.</p>, <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want the bill,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cNo real Democratic votes are available. Never were.\u201d</p>, <p><a href="http://www.atr.org/" target="_blank">Norquist\u2019s group</a> has long held sway over Republican officeholders, in no small measure because of the anti-tax pledge it has persuaded GOP candidates to sign in recent decades.\xa0 Of the 52 Republican senators, for example, 47 are listed on the group\u2019s website as having signed the pledge.</p>]

Groups challenging Trump\u2019s travel ban orders pointed to his anti-Muslim statements as evidence of his motivation.

Of the nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who have received work permits and protections under DACA, more than 78 percent are of Mexican origin, according to the complaint. The lawsuit alleges that ending the program \u201cis a culmination of Trump\u2019s oft-stated commitments \u2015 whether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some combination thereof \u2015 to punish and disparage people with Mexican roots.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among other allegations, the lawsuit contends that Trump\u2019s actions violate the Fifth Amendment by denying equal protection of the laws.

Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), the first congressman to endorse Trump during the election campaign, said he was \u201cobviously\u201d fine with it. He said he would have preferred a raising of the debt ceiling into next year, but \u201cbecause of the filibuster, he needed Schumer\u2019s buy-in.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI would trust that that\u2019s the best deal he could strike,\u201d Collins said of Trump.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said he liked the short-term nature of the deal because it would allow Congress just enough time to finish up a modified appropriations process and strike a deal on cutting spending in exchange for increasing debt.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked if that was really the lesson from Trump\u2019s quick willingness to raise the debt limit without any spending reforms, Loudermilk suggested that he trusted Trump. \u201cHe is a businessman,\u201d Loudermilk said, adding that the president\xa0\u201cunderstands you can\u2019t continue to go into debt.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of rank-and-file Republicans \u2015 like Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.), Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-W.V.), Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) and Rep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) \u2015 squirmed out of questions about the deal by saying they couldn\u2019t comment because they hadn\u2019t seen legislative text, while other Republicans in Trump-friendly districts chose their words extremely carefully.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what should be made of Trump\u2019s abilities as a dealmaker to this point, Rep.\xa0</span>Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) remained silent for 16 seconds before answering, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve given much thought to it.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats were perfectly willing to let Republicans believe they were somehow making out on Wednesday\u2019s deal. Multiple members noted that, whether he realized it or not, Trump was setting precedents that would make it difficult for him to demand concessions like wall funding in the future, though some Democrats were cautious about drawing too many lessons from the president temporarily siding with them.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cDonald Trump reverse himself, contradict himself, reverse field, break a commitment or a promise?\u201d Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) asked facetiously. \u201cDonald Trump?!\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even if Democrats were careful not to gloat too much, and Republicans were careful not to have too strong of an opinion, some conservatives were willing to concede that Trump had made a bad deal.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s very bad,\u201d said Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.). Amash thought the agreement was so bad that congressional Republicans shouldn\u2019t abide by it. \u201cWe have three separate branches of government, and the president is in charge of the executive branch, and we\u2019re in charge of the legislative branch.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) added that the deal was \u201cperplexing,\u201d while\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) issued a statement saying, \u201cThe Pelosi-Schumer-Trump deal is bad.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But save a few critical conservative voices,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0Republicans were careful not to criticize Trump.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, McConnell broke the news to his caucus matter-of-factly over lunch. According to Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the Kentucky Republican notably referred to the deal as one struck between the president and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, McConnell told reporters that \u201cthe president speaks for himself.\u201d McConnell added that he would support the deal, despite the fact that GOP leaders opposed the idea of a short-term deal just hours earlier. (Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) actually called the offer </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-debt-ceiling-democrats_us_59b02a27e4b0b5e53103120b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful\u201d</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wednesday morning.)</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she was \u201cvery surprised,\u201d because the plan initially called for a longer extension of the debt ceiling.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cTo have to go through this painful exercise again in December would not have been my first choice,\u201d she said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans had tried to raise the debt ceiling for 18 months. But after Democrats rejected that offer, and then rejected a second offer to raise the debt limit for six months, Trump leapt at the offer of raising the limit for just three months, setting up a massive negotiation this fall and one large December deadline to fund the government and again raise the debt limit.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump\u2019s director of legislative affairs, Marc Short, told reporters Wednesday that the three-month deal would allow Trump to \u201c</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jeffmason1/status/905512944557064192" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clear the decks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201d in Congress for tax reform. But the agreement is likely to do just the opposite. Lawmakers will now be locked in more negotiations, with more moving parts, because Trump took the shortest deal he could get.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, while that three-month can-kick may be the bare minimum, some Republicans, like Sen.

Wednesday by accepting a plan to keep the government funded and to increase the government\u2019s borrowing limit for another three months. GOP congressional leaders at the meeting, as well as Trump\u2019s own treasury secretary, wanted a longer period for the debt limit extension. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of siding with the leaders of his own party, Trump gave Pelosi and Schumer what they wanted. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats hope that the same situation will play out again. Republicans often need votes from across the aisle to raise the debt ceiling, because many conservatives oppose increasing the government\u2019s borrowing limit without spending cuts to decrease the deficit. With a shorter-term debt ceiling hike coming up in December at the same time as a government funding fight, Democrats will have more leverage in the budget battle.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democrats also believe it strengthens their hand with the Dream Act, a bill that would give legal status to young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. They said they will use the leverage they have on the debt ceiling to press for their priorities, with the immigration legislation high on that list. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIf a clean Dream Act does not come to the floor in September, we\u2019re prepared to attach it to other items this fall until it passes,\u201d Schumer said at a press conference Wednesday morning.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cClearing the deck for these things, it allows us to focus on [this legislation]. I think the only way this will ever happen is with a full-on campaign and public pressure on Republicans,\u201d added a Democratic congressional staffer. </span></p>, <p>The Dream Act was first introduced 16 years ago, but there\u2019s increased urgency now,\xa0after the president announced on Tuesday that he\u2019d be ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Without DACA, hundreds of thousands of so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d could begin to lose work permits and potentially be detained.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To keep it from happening, Democrats need Republicans, but they also need Trump, and some are hoping his comments and actions on Wednesday are a positive sign. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said Wednesday that he thinks he and other Republicans can make a deal with Democrats on Dreamers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI really believe Congress wants to take care of it,\u201d Trump said of protections for Dreamers. \u201cWe discussed that also today, and Chuck and Nancy would like to see something happen, and so do I. And I said if we can get something to happen, we\u2019re going to sign it and we\u2019re going to make a lot of happy people.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Trump is notoriously fickle. He did, after all, promise during the campaign to end DACA on \u201cday one\u201d of his presidency. So Democrats are still wary. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe president told America last week that he loved the Dreamers and then this week made clear that he wants to deport them, so it\u2019s getting tougher to tell what he really thinks,\u201d a senior Democratic aide said. \u201cUltimately, we need him to sign bipartisan legislation to give permanent legal status to these young people.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Democratic Hill staffer said that the deal on Wednesday \u201cdeflates some of the momentum\u201d built up after Trump\u2019s DACA announcement and will make it harder to pass the Dream Act in September. Whether it can happen in December, when the big fights will be up again, may largely depend on pressure from activists. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cCongress likes to kick decisions down the road and hope the pressure subsides so they don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d the staffer wrote in an email to HuffPost. \u201cI don\u2019t think the DREAMers will allow that strategy to work. DACA may not be a crisis for very many Members of Congress, but it is a crisis for DREAMers and they aren\u2019t going to rest.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Manley, who served for decades as a top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), said that another trip-up for Democrats could be Republicans demanding votes on their own immigration legislation for the next few months.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThere are no free shots in the Senate, so unless a deal is tightly structured with everybody on board, simply trying to pass the Dream Act in the Senate will lead to Republicans demanding a vote on every bad immigration idea imaginable in return,\u201d Manley said. </span></p>]

The choice to rescind the program and punt it off to <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca" target="_blank">Congress in six months</a> has left many outraged. The outrage has given way to lots of passionate arguments about the moral implications of rescinding DACA. But it\u2019s also led to constant, well-meaning assertions behind why rescinding DACA would be an economic calamity for America.</p>, <p>And that\u2019s a line of reasoning that, quite frankly, should make anyone in support of DACA uncomfortable.\xa0</p>, <p>As many people on social media including politician Kamala Harris pointed out after Tuesday\u2019s announcement, ending DACA could result in the economy losing out on <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/09/05/daca-donald-trump-economic-impact/" target="_blank">$280 billion of economic growth</a> over the next several years, and <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/08/31/daca-dreamers-jobs-donald-trump/" target="_blank">$460 billion in economic output</a>.\xa0</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ending DACA would cost CAs economy approximately $11B. Not only is rescinding DACA morally wrong, it\u2019ll have negative economic implications.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">DACA kids work, study, serve in military. Kicking them out undermines American traditions. This is an enormous moral and economic mistake.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Us: Our GDP will take a $400 million hit if we deport all DACA beneficiaries because 91% are employed!<br/><br/>Them: But they're stealing our jobs!</p>, <p>DACA supporters have brought up these numbers constantly over the last 24-hours, as well as the fact that many DACA recipients are hard workers, well-educated, and have the potential to be the leaders and innovators of America in the future if given the chance.\xa0</p>, <p>Barack Obama posted a response to the DACA decision to<a href="https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10155227588436749" target="_blank">\xa0Facebook</a> on Tuesday, stating that plans to rescind the program cast a shadow \u201cover some of our best and brightest young people.\u201d</p>, <p>These are all the common narratives that comes up when people want to defend not only DACA but immigration, and undocumented immigrants in particular. We pull out the tropes about how immigrants are hard working, how they do the jobs many native citizens won\u2019t do, how they stimulate the economy, how they \u201cget stuff done.\u201d</p>, <p>And this is true for many immigrants. It\u2019s worth acknowledging. But we must not fall into the trap of looking at this as a solely economic dilemma, because it isn\u2019t. While <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b">Jeff Sessions asserted in his announcement</a>\xa0that DACA\xa0\u201cdenied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens,\u201d this decision is not <em>really\xa0</em>about jobs. It\u2019s not really about economics.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Undocumented ppl deserve to stay here for reasons beyond whether or not they'll be the next Steve Jobs.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">immigrants are much more than the labor that they produce and what they mean for the economy. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DefendDACA?src=hash">#DefendDACA</a></p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Stop dehumanizing immigrants bc of their economic contribution to the US. They are MORE than their labor</p>, <p>This is, quite simply, a racial and ethical dilemma and we must not lose sight of that as we defend Dreamers and their families. Bring up economics if you must, but remember that those in favor of deporting nearly a million undocumented young people of color are, at their core, not motivated by money but by racism and xenophobia. We need to call that out.\xa0</p>, <p>It\u2019s unfortunate that the contributions of immigrants have to be put in economic terms just to convince some people of their value.\xa0Because some undocumented immigrants do not fit the respectable, noble, educated or economically valuable stereotype we construct during these times of crisis.</p>, <p>People are more than their productivity or their education. People have value because of the simple fact that they are human beings. To discuss their value in relation to the labor they provide is, by it\u2019s very definition, to dehumanize them. This is a point that many people have made in the past, and have continued to make in the hours since the DACA announcement was made. But it\u2019s a point that bears repeating, always.\xa0</p>]

The ads spread polarizing views on topics including immigration, race and gay rights, rather than backing a particular political candidate, it said.</p>, <p>Another $50,000 went to about 2,200 \u201cpotentially politically related\u201d ads and might have been bought by Russians in potential violation of U.S. election law.</p>, <p>Facebook <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/09/information-operations-update/" target="_blank">announced the findings in a blog post</a> by its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, and said that it was cooperating with federal inquiries into influence operations during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>, <p>The company said it found no link to any presidential campaign. Three-fourths of the divisive issue ads were national in scope, and the rest did not appear to reflect targeting of political swing-states as voting neared.</p>, <p>Facebook did not print the names of any of the suspended pages, but some of them included such words as \u201crefugee\u201d and \u201cpatriot.\u201d Many of the pages were connected to each other in some way.</p>, <p>Even if no laws were violated, the pages ran afoul of Facebook requirements for authenticity, setting up the suspensions.</p>, <p>More than $1 billion was spent on digital political ads during the 2016 presidential campaign, 10,000 times the presumed Russian spending identified by Facebook\u2019s security team.</p>, <p>But the findings buttress U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Russia was actively involved in shaping the election.</p>, <p>Facebook previously published a white paper on influence operations, including what it said were fake \u201camplifier\u201d accounts for propaganda, and said it was cracking down.</p>, <p>As recently as June, it told journalists that it had not found any evidence to date of Russian operatives buying election-related ads on its platform.</p>, <p><strong>RUSSIA CONNECTION</strong></p>, <p>A Facebook employee said Wednesday that there were unspecified connections between the divisive ads and a well-known Russian \u201ctroll factory\u201d in St. Petersburg that publishes comments on social media.</p>, <p>Beyond the issue ads,\xa0Facebook said it uncovered another $50,000 in political advertising that might have a link to Russia. Some of those ads were bought using computers with U.S. internet protocol addresses but set to the Russian language, though they were displayed to users in English.</p>, <p>Ellen Weintraub, a member of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, said U.S. voters deserve to know where election ads are coming from and that the money behind them is legal.</p>, <p>\u201cIt is unlawful for foreign nationals to be spending money in connection with any federal, state or local election, directly or indirectly,\u201d Weintraub said in a phone interview.</p>, <p>She declined to comment on the Facebook ads, saying she could not comment on subjects that could come before the agency.</p>, <p>Not all politically-related advertising by foreigners is illegal in America.\xa0Facebook did not give any examples of the ads at issue.</p>, <p>Weintraub said that campaign finance regulations, which require disclosure of spending and disclaimers on ads, may need to be revised to keep up with the evolution of online advertising.</p>, <p>Facebook\u2019s disclosure may be the first time a private entity has pointed to receiving Russian money related to U.S. elections, said Brendan Fischer, a program director at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington nonprofit that advocates for more transparency.</p>, <p>\u201cWhoever may have provided assistance to Russia in buying these Facebook ads is very likely in violation of the law,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Given the U.S. prohibition on foreign money being spent in elections,\xa0Facebook has a legal duty to act if it is aware of similar activity in the future, Fischer said.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m certain that the special counsel would be interested in this information, and I would presume that if Robert Mueller\u2019s team has not received this information from Facebook, they\u2019ll be asking for it soon,\u201d Fischer said.</p>, <p>Mueller is the special counsel who is investigating whether there was collusion between President Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Moscow.</p>, <p>Facebook said it was trying.</p>, <p>\u201cWe are looking at how we can apply the techniques we developed for detecting fake accounts to better detect inauthentic Pages and the ads they may run,\u201d Stamos said in the blog post.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>(Reporting by Joseph Menn and David Ingram; Editing by Leslie Adler)</p>]

But he revealed no new details about what he wants from Congress.</p>, <p>The speech was the latest installment of campaign-style events aimed at passing tax reform that began with a speech in Springfield, Missouri, a week ago and will occur on a virtually weekly basis until Congress passes legislation, according to the White House.</p>, <p>This time, however, Trump had the benefit of Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) by his side, important for the president as he tries to cajole red-state Democrats into at least entertaining his plans to revise the tax code.</p>, <p>\u201cI want all of America to be inspired by what\u2019s happened in North Dakota and the North Dakota example,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis state is a reminder of what can happen when we promote American jobs instead of obstructing them, which has been happening, believe me.\u201d</p>, <p>North Dakota has a top corporate income tax rate of <a href="https://www.nd.gov/tax/user/businesses/formspublications/corporate-income-tax" target="_blank">4.31 percent</a>, which is on the lower end of the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/state-corporate-income-tax-rates-brackets-2017/" target="_blank">44 states</a> that collect such taxes. Thanks to an oil and natural gas boom that has little to do with taxes, the state had an <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm" target="_blank">unemployment rate of 2.2 percent</a> in July, the lowest of any state in the country.</p>, <p>As a presidential candidate, Trump cast himself as a one-man panacea, famously promising that he <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/full-transcript-donald-trump-nomination-acceptance-speech-at-rnc-225974" target="_blank">\u201calone can fix\u201d</a> the country\u2019s broken political system in his speech accepting the Republican presidential nomination.</p>, <p>But in North Dakota on Wednesday, Trump, seemingly chastened by the defeat of efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, claimed that Congress would pass tax reform \u201conly if you demand it.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump appealed to them to call members of Congress, offering a script that he suggested should have particular traction with elected Democrats.</p>, <p>\u201dYou can remind them that both of the Reagan tax cuts were passed by a Democratic majority in the House, a Democratic Speaker, and the vast majority of Democrats in the Senate \u2013 including a Democratic senator from the great state of North Dakota,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it can happen.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cYou listening Heidi?\u201d he added, referring to Heitkamp. \u201cYes, Heidi\u2019s listening. Yeah, she heard that. Thank you Heidi.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna put her on the spot! I\u2019m not gonna put her on the spot!\u201d Trump concluded, drawing laughs as he pointed toward her offstage.</p>, <p>Heitkamp is up for reelection in 2018 in a state Trump won by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/north-dakota-president-clinton-trump?mcubz=3" target="_blank">nearly 36 percentage points</a>\xa0in November.</p>, <p>\u201cIf Democrats don\u2019t want to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, raise your pay and help America win \u2013 voters should deliver a clear message: Do your job to deliver for America, or find a new job,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Heitkamp joined Trump at the event after traveling with him there from Washington, D.C., on Air Force One, appearing onstage at the beginning of Trump\u2019s speech with fellow North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, Gov. Doug Burgum and Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford \u2015 all of whom are Republicans.</p>, <p>She has not committed to supporting Trump and congressional Republicans\u2019 tax reform legislation. In a statement about the event on Friday, Heitkamp emphasized her desire to reform a tax code that too often leaves her constituents \u201ctwisting in the wind\u201d without laying out explicit conditions for her support.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been pushing for both sides of the aisle to work together in Congress toward permanent, comprehensive solutions that will do away with loopholes and handouts for special interests and instead promote our small businesses, farm economy and energy industries with the fiscally responsible reforms they need to grow and expand,\u201d Heitkamp said Friday.</p>, <p>Trump is courting Democrats in order to ensure passage of more ambitious tax reforms.</p>, <p>The Democratic minority in the Senate has the power to filibuster permanent changes to the tax code that add to the projected budget deficit.</p>, <p>To avoid a filibuster on the long-lasting reductions favored by movement conservatives and big business, Trump needs the votes of at least 8 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus.</p>, <p>Trump and congressional Republicans could bypass Democrats altogether by using a process known as budget reconciliation to enact tax changes, a move that would only require a simple majority in the Senate. But budgeting rules would require that legislation to sunset after 10 years if it increases the deficit. That\u2019s why the budget-busting income and capital gains tax cuts enacted by then-President George W. Bush in 2001 would have all expired at the end of 2010 <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/16/AR2010121606200.html" target="_blank">absent legislation that extended them</a>.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not surprising that Trump is courting Heitkamp, a moderate up for reelection in a Republican state who has bucked her party leadership in the past. She was one of three Democrats who voted to confirm Trump nominee </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-confirms-neil-gorsuch_us_58e7a139e4b05413bfe244ca" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neil Gorsuch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a Supreme Court justice in April.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other centrist Democratic senators up for reelection in 2018 in states that went heavily for Trump include Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Bill Nelson (Fla.) and Claire McCaskill (Mo.).</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Heitkamp, McCaskill did not join Trump at his </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tax-reform_us_59a6c4e6e4b063ae34da49a4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">speech promoting tax reform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in her home state last Wednesday. In his remarks, Trump called McCaskill out by name, admonishing Missourians not to reelect the senator if she did not cooperate with Trump\u2019s tax agenda.</span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t do it for you, you have to have to vote her out of office,\u201d he said.</span></p>, <p>Even as Trump tries to win over Democratic lawmakers to his cause, liberal groups are pushing in the opposite direction. <a href="https://notonepenny.org/" target="_blank">Not One Penny</a>, a coalition of left-leaning groups founded on the principle that millionaires and wealthy corporations should not get a penny more in tax cuts, announced Wednesday that it is targeting Heitkamp and other potentially shaky Democratic lawmakers with\xa0<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/activists-get-personal-derail-trump-tax-cuts-n798976" target="_blank">a five-figure television ad buy</a>\xa0to discourage them from working with Trump.</p>, <p>Trump has offered a relatively broad framework to Congress for reforming taxes.\xa0He has proposed lowering the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, but is reportedly open to reducing it to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/trump-missouri-tax-plan.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">between 20 and 25 percent</a>. He would try to discourage corporations from using accounting gimmicks to stash money overseas by switching to a so-called \u201cterritorial system,\u201d in which corporations are not taxed on profits made in foreign countries.</p>, <p>He has also vowed to lower individual income tax rates without specifying what he would like them to be, simplify the tax system so every American can complete their tax returns on a single sheet of paper, and eliminate the estate tax on the financial assets of wealthy people after they die.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president has said he will pay for the tax cuts by closing loopholes that disproportionately benefit the wealthy and special interests. </span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most experts believe this is either mathematically impossible or politically unfeasible. Ending the tax deductions that </span><a href="https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=4971" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost the Treasury the most in lost revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as the mortgage interest deduction and the differential taxation of capital gains and dividends, either benefit middle-class households or a powerful constituency like large investors.</span></p>, <p>Trump\u2019s policy rationale for reducing corporate taxes has also come under scrutiny from experts.\xa0</p>, <p>He claimed again at the event on Wednesday that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world.</p>, <p>In fact, while the U.S.\xa0has a high official rate, corporations use deductions and other credits to pay considerably less than that \u2015 in many cases enjoying a lighter burden than foreign competitors. In practice, the average U.S. corporation pays a tax rate of <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/08/07/541797699/fact-check-does-the-u-s-have-the-highest-corporate-tax-rate-in-the-world" target="_blank">18.6 percent</a>, according to the Congressional Budget Office \u2015 lower than the average in Argentina, Japan and the United Kingdom.</p>, <p>And it is not at all clear that there is a correlation between tax burdens and the willingness of corporations to invest in domestic growth. Between 2008 and 2016, median employment at 92 profitable U.S. corporations with tax rates under 20 percent <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org/report-corporate-tax-cuts-boost-ceo-pay-not-jobs/" target="_blank">actually declined by 1 percent</a>, according to a report by the Institute for Policy Studies.</p>, <p>Contrary to what Trump claims, moving to a so-called \u201cterritorial tax\u201d system would actually encourage corporations to offshore their profits, by exempting foreign profits from U.S. taxes, according to Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.</p>, <p>\u201cIt is against the interest of workers in the United States,\u201d Marr said.</p>, <p>\u201cThe economic narrative of the campaign was that you had these working-class people who have too long been ignored,\u201d he added. \u201cThen when it comes time for his plan, when he\u2019s moving around trillions of dollars around, those people are ignored. That\u2019s a betrayal.\u201d</p>]

His words and tweets could come back to bite him again on DACA.\xa0</p>, <p>The suit also argues that rescinding DACA would harm the states\u2019 economies, colleges, residents and businesses.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that President Trump\u2019s DACA repeal would cause huge economic harm to New York \u2015\xa0and that it\u2019s driven by President Trump\u2019s personal anti-Mexican bias,\u201d New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.</p>, <p>The states also asked that the federal government be prohibited from sharing DACA recipients\u2019\xa0personal info with Immigration and Customs Enforcement <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/as-trump-ends-daca-dreamers-worry-about-family_us_59af37a7e4b0354e440d8121">in order to deport them</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>In addition to New York and the District of Columbia, the states involved are Massachusetts, Washington, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit marks the second legal challenge in federal court to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to nix former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature immigration reform, which Obama carried out by executive action.</span></p>, <p>Trump announced on Tuesday that he was terminating the program, and the first DACA recipients will begin to lose their work permits and protections in six months. The move could eventually drive nearly 800,000 so-called \u201cDreamers,\u201d who came to the U.S., as children out of the legal workforce and put them at greater risk of being deported.</p>, <p>A lawsuit filed last year on behalf of DACA recipient Mart\xedn Jonathan Batalla Vidal in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn sought to overturn the decision to enjoin a similar program that would have shielded the undocumented parents of U.S. citizens from deportation and expanded the scope of DACA. On Tuesday, the lawyers for the National Immigration Law Center, Make the Road New York, and the Worker &amp; Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic at Yale Law School who brought the case asked to amend the complaint to also oppose the termination of DACA. \xa0</p>, <p>\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s consistent anti-Mexican statements, from the start of his campaign through his rally last month in Phoenix, demonstrate his intent to discriminate against Mexican and Latino individuals, who will bear the overwhelming burden of the DACA termination,\u201d the filing Tuesday in the Batalla Vidal case states.</p>, <p>U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis scheduled a hearing for the request to amend the complaint for Sept. 14.</p>, <p>The two lawsuits against Trump for ending DACA hinge on similar claims. They say the Trump administration flouted the Administrative Procedure Act by canceling the DACA program with little notice and no time for public comment.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also both describe nixing DACA as the culmination of Trump\u2019s alleged hostility toward Mexicans, citing his harsh comments on the campaign trail about Mexican immigrants.</span></p>, <p>Justice Department spokesman Devin O\u2019Malley defended the decision to phase out the program despite the lawsuits, reiterating the administration\u2019s claim that Obama\u2019s creation of the program unlawfully skirted the authority of Congress. \xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWhile the plaintiffs in today\u2019s lawsuits may believe that an arbitrary circumvention of Congress is lawful, the Department of Justice looks forward to defending this Administration\u2019s position,\u201d O\u2019Malley wrote in a statement.\xa0</p>, <p>Legal analysts consulted by HuffPost said the cases would be challenging to win but raise complex legal arguments that could sway a court to either reverse the Trump administration\u2019s decision or delay it.</p>, <p>Any president has wide latitude to take executive action or to undo the executive actions of past presidents. But if either lawsuit succeeds in convincing a federal judge that Trump was driven by an intent to discriminate against Mexican immigrants, his decision could be invalidated as a violation of the Constitution.</p>, <p>\u201cIf they can prove this was motivated by racial animus, then a court would likely strike it down as a violation of equal protection,\u201d Stephen Legomsky, a professor at Washington University School of Law and former legal counsel for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told HuffPost. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a slam dunk by any means. Much will depend on the particular judge they land and how the judge assesses the evidence.\u201d</p>, <p>Muzaffar Chishti, a legal analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said the case against ending DACA has a chance of success given the Trump administration\u2019s losses in federal court over the attempt to restrict visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. \xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWe have frankly no idea how the courts are going to react, but there are some substantive issues for the courts to deal with,\u201d Chishti told HuffPost. \u201cThe legal front on this has been opened.\u201d</p>, <p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D) plans to bring a third lawsuit in the coming days, according to a spokesperson for his office. He plans to file the suit in California, which is home to approximately 200,000 Dreamers.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cPresident Trump has turned his back on hundreds of thousands of children and young Americans who came forward and put their trust in our government. But in terminating DACA, the Trump Administration has also violated the Constitution and federal law,\u201d Becerra said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>, <p>Attorneys general in other states have also voiced support for DACA. Twenty of them, led by Becerra, signed a <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press_releases/7-21-17%20%20Letter%20from%20State%20AGs%20to%20President%20Trump%20re%20DACA.final_.pdf">letter to Trump</a> in July asking him to maintain the program. The attorneys general of all the states involved in the lawsuit filed Wednesday signed that letter, along with those from Maine, Maryland and Minnesota. \xa0</p>, <p>Other state attorneys general helped contribute to DACA\u2019s demise. Ten states, led by Texas, threatened legal action against Trump if he did not rescind DACA by Sept. 5, although one of the state attorneys general <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tennessee-daca-herbert-slatery_us_59a9c26de4b0b5e530feba7e">backed off his demand</a> last week. Trump still eventually agreed to their demand.\xa0</p>, <p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions said while announcing the decision on Tuesday that he had determined the original DACA program was unconstitutional and would fail in the courts based on a past injunction against the broader program by Obama to protect certain undocumented parents and expand DACA. Although those policies were blocked before going into effect, there was never a final court ruling on the merits of that case, and it\u2019s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dreamers-daca-decision-trump-sessions_us_59aee270e4b0354e440d079a">not a certainty</a>\xa0that a court would draw the same conclusions for the DACA program already in effect.\xa0</p>, <p><em>This was a breaking story and has been updated throughout.</em></p>]

Her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/michelle-goldberg?mcubz=1" target="_blank">work</a> quickly stood out and prompted internal speculation that she could be in line for a full-time columnist job, one of the most prestigious perches in journalism.\xa0</p>, <p>However, Goldberg told HuffPost she never dreamed of landing a columnist slot. Shortly after the announcement on Wednesday, Goldberg said she was still \u201cstaggered by what an honor it is to have that platform at this moment.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s the opposite of the end of history,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cSuddenly everything has been thrown open and it\u2019s really terrifying. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a silver lining as a writer is that it\u2019s suddenly such an ideologically fertile time. It\u2019s a terrible and harrowing time. But there is so much to explore.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cOne thing I hope to do is to be a voice for the majority of the people in this country who cannot believe what the fuck is going on,\u201d she said.\xa0</span>\xa0</p>, <p>The Times has recently been incorporating new voices by adding contributing columnists. But the\xa0<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html?mcubz=1" target="_blank">stable</a>\xa0of 14 full-time columnists, which boasts high-profile writers like Paul Krugman and David Brooks, has lacked diversity. Goldberg is one of three women in the group, joining Maureen Dowd and Gail Collins. Charles Blow is the only writer of color among the group.</p>, <p>And the last columnist hire by Times editorial page editor James Bennet, conservative writer Bret Stephens, ignited controversy. Some Times readers even canceled their subscriptions in April over the selection of Stephens, a self-identified \u201cclimate agnostic\u201d known for mocking environmentalists. Bennet defended the hire at the time, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bret-stephens-new-york-times_us_58f12c80e4b0b9e9848bed3e">telling HuffPost</a>\xa0it was \u201ctotally unfair\u201d to label Stephens a \u201cclimate denialist.\u201d</p>, <p>Goldberg, who has written for The New Yorker, The New Republic and The Nation,\xa0<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/michelle-goldberg?mcubz=1" target="_blank">focuses</a>\xa0largely on politics, gender, religion and ideology and is the author of three books: <em>Kingdom Coming: The Rise of Christian Nationalism</em>, <em>The Means of Reproduction: Sex, Power, and the Future of the World</em>, and <em>The Goddess Pose: The Audacious Life of Indra Devi, the Woman Who Helped Bring Yoga to the West</em>.</p>, <p>While progressive, Goldberg wouldn\u2019t likely be identified as coming from the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party.

She said she understood if some people in the Sanders wing of the progressive movement \u201c<span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to feel underrepresented,\u201d yet she described much of her work as being \u201d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in dialogue with people to my left.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Goldberg said she\u2019s interested in arguments found in Jacobin, a socialist-leaning magazine, the growth of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), and debates on the left over the radical, anti-fascist group known as antifa.\xa0</span></p>, <p>\u201cOne thing I can do is to give voice to people\u2019s incredulity as they watch their democracy crumble around them and nobody seems to be doing anything about it,\u201d she said.\xa0</p>, <p>The Times, whose columnists generally veer center-left to center-right and at times share views on foreign intervention whether liberal or conservative, also doesn\u2019t boast a full-time columnist representing more of the Steve Bannon-like populist, nationalist viewpoints found on Breitbart News.\xa0The Times\u2019 conservative columnists \u2015 \xa0Brooks, Stephens and Ross Douthat \u2015 have all been critical of President Donald Trump.\xa0</p>, <p>In a memo, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennet and deputy editorial page editors Jim Dao and Katie Kingsbury promised \u201cfurther additions to our lineup in the coming months as we continue to broaden the range of Times debate about consequential questions.\u201d</span></p>, <p>Read the full memo below:</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All:</span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We\u2019re delighted to tell you that Michelle Goldberg is joining the strongest lineup of columnists in the world. Many of you know Michelle from her regular contributions here, as well as from her column at Slate, so you have some sense already of her intellectual depth, courage and ambition.

She knows how to write fast and forcefully off the news and how to structure a complex, magazine-length argument. She is interested in pretty much everything, and she sees no contradiction between having fierce convictions and keeping an open mind. She is, in other words, our kind of colleague. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can expect further additions to our lineup in the coming months as we continue to broaden the range of Times debate about consequential questions.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle\u2019s first day will be in about two weeks, and we\u2019ll ask you to join us in welcoming her then.</span></p>, <p>\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">All best</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James, Jim and Katie</span></p>]

Six percent of all 2016 voters say they regret the decision they made last year, and 3 percent those who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 say the same.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fewer than 4 in 10 of Obama/Trump voters say they\u2019re sure they\u2019ll vote GOP in the 2018 midterms.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data comes from an online YouGov poll cond</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ucted in July by the Democracy Fund </span><a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publications/2017-voter-survey/first-six-months" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter Study Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which describes itself as a collaboration by \u201cnearly two dozen </span><a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/participants"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysts and scholars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from across the political spectrum.\u201d The survey reinterviewed 5,000 Americans who\u2019d previously been polled in 2011, 2012 and 2016, allowing the researchers to track the shifts in their political opinions.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are now faced with several questions:\xa0</span><a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/upshot/the-obama-trump-voters-are-real-heres-what-they-think.html?_r=0&amp;referer=https://t.co/SOxnIVJnNQ?amp=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how many Obama/Trump voters are persuadable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and to what degree </span><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-dont-need-trumps-voters-to-retake-the-house/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pursuing the sliver who are</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should take precedence over drumming up midterm turnout among the Democratic base or </span><a href="https://twitter.com/gdebenedetti/status/903018484338176000"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wooing those who voted third-party or sat out 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 6.7 million and 9.2 million Americans may have backed Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/just-how-many-obama-2012-trump-2016-voters-were-there/">an analysis Geoffrey Skelley of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball</a>\xa0conducted earlier this year.\xa0He</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0concluded such voters \u201cplayed a crucial role\u201d in Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. According to the Voter Study Group, they represent about 9 percent or 10 percent of Obama\u2019s supporters.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cAmong the people who supported Trump, they\u2019re showing some of the highest levels of dissatisfaction,\u201d said Robert Griffin, the director of quantitative analysis at the progressive Center for American Progress and one of the participants in the Voter Study Group. \u201cI think there are some people who argue this is a segment of the population the Democrats can\u2019t win back, but this is already a population that\u2019s already shown itself to have some flip-flopping tendencies \u2015 to vote for one party and then to vote for another. So, I think the evidence would suggest that this is a group that\u2019s in play. They\u2019re by no means lost to the Democratic Party.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The behavior of these voters stands out in a political environment often characterized by inflexible hyper-partisanship, as they are less tethered to a partisan identity than most of the electorate. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although they are considerably right-leaning and </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-trump-democrat/2017/08/04/0d5d06bc-7920-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html?utm_term=.4c1cfc19eb9e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by no means largely wayward Democrats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Obama/Trump voters do appear in some ways significantly different from the rest of Trump\u2019s electorate, according to additional YouGov polling conducted for the Economist in June and shared with HuffPost.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They\u2019re less likely, for instance, to closely follow politics, to consider themselves conservatives, or to feel a strong kinship with the Republican Party. They\u2019re less likely than other Trump voters to consider immigration a very important issue. And although they aren\u2019t significantly likelier to express personal worries or to name the economy as a top issue, they are more bearish about its prospects. Just 46 percent of Obama/Trump voters, compared to 61 percent of other Trump voters, say the economy is getting better. And 36 percent, compared to 58 percent of other Trump voters, think Trump cares a lot about people like them.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Trump voters, no matter whom they supported in previous years, aren\u2019t rueing their decision. About 70 percent of Obama/Trump voters said in July that they approved of the current president\u2019s performance, according to the Voter Study Group.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cDonald Trump, in my opinion, he put down his feet and started running right away, as soon as he was inaugurated, to move his agenda forward. I like that,\u201d another Obama/Trump voter, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cornell Rankin, told HuffPost earlier this summer. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rankin, a resident of Wilmington, Delaware, who originally hails from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said he hoped that Trump would restore manufacturing jobs. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI grew up with the steel mills and other manufacturing that was [flourishing] during my childhood, and by the time I got old enough to get into the workforce, those things were dwindling and eventually closed down,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now the manufacturing in western Pennsylvania is almost nothing. And I would like to see the return of some manufacturing because as a nation we used to be very strong at providing everything that we need.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unlike even many Republicans, Rankin called Trump\u2019s pugnaciousness \u201crefreshing,\u201d saying he liked having someone in office to confront the status quo.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Obama/Trump voters, however, aren\u2019t wholly upbeat, especially in comparison with straight-ticket Republican voters. Just 35 percent in the Voter Study Group\u2019s poll </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">strongly </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">approve of Trump\u2019s performance, significantly below the level of Trump voters as a whole. (A 63 percent majority of Obama voters who backed third-party candidates, meanwhile, disapprove of Trump entirely.)</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI still have hope for him. I have not given up,\u201d said Ella Johnson, a 62-year-old from Rochester, Minnesota, who backed Trump in 2016 after voting for Obama in 2012. Johnson, who picked Trump because she thought he\u2019d do a better job of working with Congress, praised him for fighting for what he wanted, even if it meant taking on other politicians or the press. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Johnson also expressed concerns about Trump\u2019s record on health care,\xa0noted that the president hasn\u2019t yet accomplished much, and said he often seemed to let his ego get the best of him. And although she hasn\u2019t given a great deal of thought yet to the midterm elections, she\u2019s more than open to the idea of supporting a Democrat.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That openness is not entirely uncommon among Obama voters who didn\u2019t support Clinton, according to the study. Thirty-six percent of Obama voters who voted for a third-party candidate last year say they plan to vote Democratic in the midterms, and 23 percent that they haven\u2019t made up their minds. Obama/Trump voters, while less Democratic-leaning, aren\u2019t solidly Republican either: 39 percent of Obama/Trump voters say they plan to back a Republican candidate in 2018, according to the study, with 17 percent saying they\u2019ll vote Democratic and another 41 percent still unsure.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given their loose tethers to partisanship, even those who remain happy with Trump may not necessarily be a reliable vote for the GOP.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cSometimes it\u2019s not a bad thing to have a little opposition in the government,\u201d Rankin said.</span></p>]

Both sides have every intention of avoiding default in December and look forward to working together on the many issues before us,\u201d Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement after the meeting.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats had gone into the meeting hoping to get exactly this outcome.\xa0A congressional aide briefed on the meeting said Republican leaders wanted an 18-month debt ceiling hike, and then suggested six months instead. Pelosi and Schumer dismissed a six-month hike, and Trump eventually agreed to the Democrats\u2019 three-month proposal.</span></p>, <p><span dir="ltr">Another source briefed on the meeting said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sided with the Republican leaders in the room in wanting a longer debt limit extension.

With a shorter-term debt ceiling hike coming up in December at the same time as a government funding fight, Democrats will have more leverage in the budget battle.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But by siding with Democrats, Trump rejected the wishes of his own party \u2015 a move that reportedly\xa0<a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/905475282676670469" target="_blank">left Republicans furious</a>\xa0\u2015 and it\u2019s not clear how many GOP lawmakers will go along with this deal.\xa0</span></p>, <p>McConnell said he would add the three-month funding and debt ceiling extension to\xa0<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-prepares-for-harvey-relief-vote/2017/09/06/62919058-92fc-11e7-89fa-bb822a46da5b_story.html?utm_term=.315002cf9207" target="_blank">legislation providing $7.85 billion in aid for Hurricane Harvey</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cThe president can speak for himself, but his feeling was that we needed to come together to not create a picture of divisiveness at a time of genuine national crisis.

In the first quarter of 2017, it brought in </span><a href="http://thehill.com/latino/329182-house-hispanic-pac-breaks-fundraising-record"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over $2 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, breaking its previous fundraising record for a three-month period.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, the PAC raised about </span><a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00365536/?cycle=2016"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$6.1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the entire 2015-2016 election cycle \u2015 a period when it had the benefit of national attention on a presidential race in which the Democratic nominee,\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/hillary-clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, was highly favored to win.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trouble is, just half of the 30 full voting members of the Congress Hispanic Caucus have publicly endorsed single-payer health care. (The caucus has 31 members including Northern Mariana Islands Delegate Gregorio Sablan, but he does not have the authority to vote on legislation that makes it to the House floor.) </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 28 CHC members with full voting rights in the House, 15 are among the 117 co-sponsors of </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/cosponsors"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single-payer legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduced by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.). </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 13 CHC members in the House who have not signed onto the bill include Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.), chair of Bold PAC and a member of House Democratic leadership; Rep. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), a nationally prominent former Texas state lawmaker, whose twin brother Julian Castro served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/barack-obama"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barack Obama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> administration.</span></p>, <p>Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the two senators in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, have not revealed whether they plan to support Sanders\u2019 single-payer legislation or otherwise indicated it is a policy they support.</p>, <p>Menendez\u2019s office pointed to his past support for a public health insurance option. Cortez Masto\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of her current positions.</p>, <p>Reps. Cardenas, Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), Lou Correa (D-Calif.), Jim Costa (D-Calif.), Salud Carbajal (D-Calif.), Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.), all of whom are CHC members who have not co-sponsored the Conyers bill, received <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgot.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00365536">major contributions</a> from Bold PAC in the 2015-2016 cycle.</p>, <p>A number of other House Democrats who have yet to sign onto Conyers\u2019 bill were recipients of Bold PAC largesse last cycle as well, including Democratic Reps. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), Brad Schneider (Ill.), Sean Patrick Maloney (N.Y.), Stephanie Murphy (Fla.), Charlie Crist (Fla.), Josh Gottheimer (N.J.) and Cheri Bustos (Ill.).\xa0</p>, <p>A spokesperson for Bold PAC said the decision to fundraise off of the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d push is not intended to reflect the positions of all CHC members, or candidates it endorses.</p>, <p>\u201cThe passage of Trumpcare would be a disaster and Medicare for All is one solution that many of our Members support,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.</p>, <p>\u201cMinority communities are more likely to lack access to affordable healthcare, which is why CHC Bold PAC is committed to ensuring that healthcare is available for every American \u2015 not just for a privileged few,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cCHC BOLD PAC will fight with the progressive community to protect the American people from Trumpcare with everything we have.\u201d</p>, <p>The spokesperson would not say whether the PAC is even planning to urge its members or candidates it endorses to sign on to single-payer legislation.</p>, <p>But given the strident tone of the fundraising emails, rank-and-file Democrats might not be aware of the subtleties in the PAC\u2019s single-payer stance.</p>, <p>In an Aug. 6 email with the subject line \u201cMISSING your support of Bernie\u2019s new bill! (sign right now &gt;&gt;),\u201d Bold PAC employed the urgency of a political candidate facing a deadline to solicit petition signatures in support of Sanders\u2019 yet-to-be-announced \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill. Using issue-based petitions and surveys to raise money is a common digital fundraising tactic.</p>, <p>\u201cHUGE UPDATE: Bernie Sanders is \u2018absolutely\u2019 introducing Medicare for All bill.\xa0<em>YES!!!</em> We need 50,000 signatures immediately \u2015 or Republicans will CRUSH our chances of passing Bernie\u2019s landmark plan,\u201d the email stated alongside a photo of Sanders and a link labeled \u201csupport Medicare for all\u201d that led to a landing page with the petition.</p>, <p>A follow-up email on Aug. 10 with the subject line \u201cMedicare for All (Your Feedback Needed \u2015 URGENT)\u201d warns against the dire consequences of not completing a survey about single-payer health care.</p>, <p>\u201cBernie Sanders is officially introducing a Medicare for All plan to guarantee <em>every</em> American the right and access to affordable, quality healthcare. <em>This is groundbreaking!</em> But Republicans are still determined to DESTROY our healthcare system, no matter who suffers. So we need to find out where you stand NOW,\u201d Bold PAC admonishes the recipients.</p>, <p>Two other similar email solicitations invoke liberal economist Robert Reich and comic Jon Stewart, both of whom support single-payer.</p>, <p>If readers sign the petitions or complete the surveys, they are led to other webpages that solicit donations that supposedly go toward the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d fight.</p>, <p>Bold PAC even has a special <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/medicare-for-all-fund">\u201cMedicare for All fund\u201d donation webpage</a> it has set up on the Democratic fundraising site Act Blue where supporters can \u201cchip in $5 or $10 right now to support Medicare for All.\u201d</p>, <p>A senior aide to a progressive House Democrat,\xa0speaking on condition of anonymity, argued that Bold PAC\u2019s behavior was outside the norm in terms of its disregard for \u201cauthenticity.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIn general, representing your actual positions helps avoid the messiness associated with taking conflicting positions,\u201d the aide said.</p>, <p>To complicate matters further, Bold PAC has received major funding from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pac2pac.php?cycle=2016&amp;cmte=C00365536" target="_blank">pharmaceutical and health insurance companies</a> that ardently oppose modest health care reforms, let alone single-payer legislation. The drug makers Amgen, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck each donated $10,000 to Bold PAC in the 2015-2016 cycle, as did health insurers Anthem and Humana. Eli Lilly, another pharmaceutical company, also contributed $7,500.</p>, <p>\u201cThey\u2019re telling their grassroots supporters that they want to get profit out of heath care,\u201d the House Democratic aide said. \u201cAt the same time, they\u2019re taking corporate PAC money from the industries most opposed to Medicare for All \u2015 Pharma and the health insurance industry. It\u2019s disingenuous at best and malicious at worst.\u201d</p>, <p>But Kenneth Pennington, who was digital director for Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, said fundraising on an issue that does not enjoy consensus among a PAC\u2019s members is \u201cnot uncommon.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI can only imagine they\u2019d raise even more if 100% of the membership backed the Conyers bill,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Michael Lighty, director of public policy for the National Nurses United, a labor union that is one of the most prominent single-payer proponents, characterized the fundraising campaign as a reflection of politicians\u2019 growing recognition that the Democratic base supports single-payer \u2015 even as they remain wary of backing it themselves.</p>, <p>Nearly three-quarters of Democrats \u2015 73 percent \u2015 support replacing the Affordable Care Act with a \u201cfederally funded healthcare program providing insurance for all Americans,\u201d according to a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/191504/majority-support-idea-fed-funded-healthcare-system.aspx">May 2016 Gallup poll</a>.</p>, <p>In a poll commissioned by the NNU in California, 69 percent of California\u2019s Latino voters supported the state-level single-payer bill that NNU is fighting to pass.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI would urge [Bold PAC]\xa0to have every member of the PAC be a co-sponsor of the legislation introduced by John Conyers or Bernie Sanders. Anything less is not a legitimate commitment,\u201d Lighty said.</p>, <p>Fundraising off of single-payer without taking a firm stance in favor of it risks being seen as exploitative, he posited.</p>, <p>\u201cUnless they take a substantive position it could be viewed that way and that\u2019s what they should want to avoid,\u201d Lighty said.</p>, <p>The campaign for single-payer \u201cis not about a symbolic political fundraising strategy. This is about providing health care for people who are dying and suffering,\u201d he added.</p>]

The ruling comes as a legal battle continues over the ID rules that state wants for voters.</p>, <p>Texas in 2011 passed a law, SB 14, requiring voters present photo identification, such as a driver\u2019s license, gun permit or passport, when casting a ballot. Last year, U.S. District Court Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos blocked the law, ruling it was passed to intentionally discriminate against blacks and Latinos.</p>, <p>The state this year passed SB 5, which was designed fix the problems Gonzales Ramos had found with SB 14.

A temporary stay of the ruling by Gonzales Ramos blocking SB 5 while the court considers that decision \u201cwill minimize confusion among both voters and trained election officials,\u201d the two judges wrote.</p>, <p>Judges James Graves, Jr. dissented from the court\u2019s ruling, writing the \u201ccorrect approach would be to stay both the district court\u2019s order and the new legislation.\u201d</p>]

The announcement presents an opportunity to mobilize and push Congress to pass immigration reform so the 800,000 DACA recipients will be protected. If you can spare one hour of your day, your actions might make a difference.</p>, <p>Leave a comment <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to let the president know how much you disagree with his decision to end DACA. Here is a sample comment:</p>, <p><em>Mr. President,</em></p>, <p><em>As an American citizen, I am appalled by your decision to terminate protections for 800,000 DACA beneficiaries who pay taxes, attend our colleges and universities, and contribute to our communities as doctors, lawyers, teachers, social workers and business owners. Your decision could reduce the U.S. GDP by more than $400 billion over the next decade. I urge you to work with Congress to pass a legislative solution that will ensure the protection of those affected by your decision to terminate DACA.</em></p>, <p>After you have submitted a comment, call the White House and leave a message at 202-456-1111.</p>, <p>First, find your representative and senators <a href="https://whoismyrepresentative.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. Just enter your zip code and click on their names to obtain their contact information.</p>, <p>Second, pick up the phone and call each one of them. You can ask to speak with the staffer in charge of immigration policy or just leave a message. Here is a sample script:</p>, <p><em>Hello,</em></p>, <p><em>My name is ____, and I am one of your constituents. I am calling to express my discontent with the White House\u2019s decision to end DACA and ask Senator/Representative ______ to support legislative action that will protect immigrants affected by the termination of DACA. Eight hundred thousand lives are affected because of the president\u2019s decision to end DACA, and now it is time for Congress to pass a law that would provide a pathway to citizenship for this group of immigrants. Does Senator/Representative _____ currently support the Dream<a href="https://www.nilc.org/issues/immigration-reform-and-executive-actions/dreamact/dream-act-2017-summary-and-faq/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">\xa0Act</a> or <a href="https://unitedwedream.org/press-releases/the-american-hope-act-2017/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hope Act</a>?</em></p>, <p>If you are told your representative/senator supports either the Dream\xa0(in the Senate) or Hope Act (in the House of Representatives), say thank you and let them know you applaud that decision.</p>, <p>If you are told your representative/senator <strong><em>does not</em></strong> support either the Dream or Hope Act, ask the staffer to explain why. Then, let the staffer know the human and economic impact that leaving 800,000 youth undocumented would have (see script for the White House above).</p>, <p>If you are told your representative/senator has not made up his or her mind on the Dream or Hope Act, let the staffer know you urge the representative/senator to support these legislative efforts.</p>, <p>Take 15 minutes to tweet to different members of Congress and the White House, letting them know you (1) disapprove the president is terminating the DACA program and (2) you expect Congress to pass legislative action to protect those affected. Make sure to Tweet at the president @realdonaldtrump and Speaker Paul Ryan @SpeakerRyan.</p>, <p>Here are some sample messages:</p>, <p><a href="https://dreamacttoolkit.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">This tool kit</a> has some images that target specific members of Congress on Twitter.</p>, <p>Repetition is critical. As an ally, you can block one hour every other day (or every day) to contact the White House and Congress, letting them know you expect them to pass a law that would protect those affected by the president\u2019s decision to terminate DACA. Even if you feel confident your representative or senators support legislation to protect DACA beneficiaries, it is important you continue to call them. Remember they are also receiving calls from those who oppose DACA, so your calls are essential to keep the issue relevant.</p>, <p>The process will probably take several weeks or even months, and you might become rather frustrated with Congress\u2019s inaction or slow progress. If you do become annoyed, remember some of the people affected by the president\u2019s decision to end DACA have been living in limbo for decades, sometimes for 20 or 30 years.</p>, <p>The one hour you spend a few times a week will keep the pressure on Congress to act. Your advocacy <strong><em>can</em></strong> make a difference.</p>]

How they handle these three issues will determine whether they are successful on election night.</p>, <p>No candidate has had to confront the hacking of their private campaign materials.\xa0That is, until 2016. When Hillary Clinton\u2019s Democratic presidential campaign fell victim to a Russian-backed hacking operation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/house-democrats-hacking-dccc.html?mcubz=0" target="_blank">down-ballot candidates across the country were targeted as well</a>. On this week\u2019s episode of \u201cCandidate Confessional,\u201d we interviewed one of those targets: <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Annette_Taddeo" target="_blank">Annette Taddeo</a>, a Democrat who ran for Congress in South Florida.</p>, <p>Taddeo started her campaign worrying about her name recognition, trying to win over the dominant Cuban immigrant voting bloc and having to make up a 24-point deficit against her primary opponent, former U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia. Unlike her opponent, who had <a href="http://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2016/02/garcia-seeking-congressional-comeback-but-old-scandal-could-hurt-030951" target="_blank">his share of baggage</a>, Taddeo saw her clean record as her selling point.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThe strength was cleanliness \u2015 the not having any kind of blemish on my record,\u201d Taddeo explained. \u201cThis district in particular was very tired of the scandals.\u201d</p>, <p>The hack of her campaign changed all that.</p>, <p>Taddeo knew that the <a href="http://dccc.org/about/" target="_blank">Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee</a> had been hacked. She said she asked party officials about it. No one raised alarms that her materials might have been stolen. She didn\u2019t find out her campaign had been hacked until it was too late: when a blogger started to publish stories using the private materials.</p>, <p>\u201cThere was no preparation and no warning,\u201d she told us.</p>, <p>Among the materials leaked to reporters: Taddeo\u2019s opposition research on Garcia as well as the Democratic Party leaders\u2019 <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/291523-leaked-dccc-docs-detail-fl-dem-candidates-weaknesses" target="_blank">private concerns</a>\xa0about Taddeo as a candidate. One memo considered her an \u201cincompetent candidate\u201d and worried that voters could look at her and see just another \u201cwealthy elitist.\u201d</p>, <p>Taddeo, who had been gaining ground on Garcia, suddenly saw her campaign stall. Garcia used the materials to paint her as the\xa0<em>real</em> dirty candidate. \u201cI definitely felt like I was out there campaigning sort of naked,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way I can describe it because you\u2019re an open book.\u201d</p>, <p>Taddeo lost to Garcia <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/election/article98951537.html" target="_blank">by 2 percentage points in the primary</a>. Republicans were then able to successfully use the hacked materials against Garcia, who lost to Carlos Curbelo in November. With a just few keystrokes, hackers were able to take down two Democratic candidates in one congressional district.</p>, <p>At the time of our interview with Taddeo, she said she had not been interviewed by the FBI about the hacking.</p>, <p><strong>Listen to the latest episode of \u201cCandidate Confessional\u201d above.\xa0</strong></p>, <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cCandidate Confessional\u201d is produced by Zach Young.\xa0</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">To listen to this podcast later, download it on\xa0</span></em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/candidate-confessional-defeated-politicians-tell-all/id1073764351?mt=2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Podcasts</span></em></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.\xa0</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you\u2019re there, please rate and review our show.\xa0</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">To subscribe, visit the following:\xa0</span></em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/candidate-confessional-defeated-politicians-tell-all/id1073764351?mt=2"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Podcasts</span></em></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0/\xa0</span></em><a href="https://www.acast.com/candidateconfessional"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acast</span></em></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0/\xa0</span></em><a href="https://play.radiopublic.com/candidate-confessional-defeated-politicians-tell-all-Wdpz5W"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">RadioPublic</span></em></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0/\xa0</span></em><a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/I7wiu6wwrbxnfacu5na54x4nnte"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Play</span></em></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0/\xa0</span></em><a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-huffington-post/candidate-confessional"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stitcher</span></em></a><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0/\xa0</span></em><a href="http://rss.acast.com/candidateconfessional"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSS</span></em></a>\xa0</p>]
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/as-trump-ends-daca-dreamers-worry-about-family_us_59af37a7e4b0354e440d8121?utm_campaign=hp_fb_pages&utm_source=politics_fb&utm_medium=facebook&ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000013&section=politics|<h1 class="headline__title">As Trump Nixes DACA, Dreamers Worry About Their Families</h1>|[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AUSTIN \u2015 When Karla P\xe9rez handed over a stack of paperwork including her home address, photographs and her fingerprints to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services five years ago to apply for <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/daca">DACA</a>, she was still living at home with her parents. To gain the ability to work legally under the new program despite being undocumented, P\xe9rez had to make the tough choice to give the Department of Homeland Security not just her own address, but the one for her mom and dad as well. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThat always weighs heavily on my mind,\u201d P\xe9rez said. \u201cMy biggest concern right now is my parents because DHS has my information\u2026 I\u2019m not so much worried for myself as for my family.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Trump administration <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009" target="_blank">announced the termination of DACA on Tuesday</a>, several of the program\u2019s recipients interviewed by HuffPost described feeling a sense of both injustice and betrayal. The program, whose full title is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, shielded undocumented immigrants who came to the country as minors from deportation and allowed them to work legally in the United States. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To take advantage of the program, DACA recipients had to make a leap of faith that the federal government would not turn around after Barack Obama\u2019s presidency ended and use their own information against them. </span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of them, like P\xe9rez, were living with undocumented family members when they provided their address to USCIS on their first applications. As the Trump administration eviscerates the last major immigration reform of the Obama years, many DACA beneficiaries were not worried so much about themselves as their parents or other family members left out of the program and in limbo by stalled attempts to pass farther-reaching reforms through Congress.\xa0</span></p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m freaked out,\u201d P\xe9rez said. \u201cBut at the same time, there\u2019s this renewed commitment to fight for everyone in the immigrant community, including my parents.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juan Belman, 24, obtained DACA while studying at the University of Texas at Austin. He\u2019s since moved on to a job at the Workers Defense Project, an organization dedicated to recouping the unpaid money owed to low-wage workers. The address Belman submitted with his DACA application was his family home, where his undocumented parents live. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThat\u2019s a concern,\u201d Belman told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m not always home. That\u2019s something I worry about. We\u2019ve given them all our information.\u201d </span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another DACA recipient, who asked to be identified only as Luis in order to protect his family, remembered feeling ecstatic back in 2012 when the Obama administration rolled out DACA. Having fled years ago as an unaccompanied minor from gang violence and an abusive father in Central America, Luis had no way to apply to normalize his status before DACA.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cMany of us ran from persecution, from violence, from absolute levels of poverty,\u201d Luis said. \u201cAll of the sudden, a Dreamer is told that there is going to be a line. Of course you\u2019re going to jump on line!\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cOf course I trusted it,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause I believe in this nation and I want to serve this nation, regardless of its politics and its different administrations.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now enrolled in graduate school, he worries about what the Trump administration\u2019s decision to kill the program will mean for his ability to work here, or the impact it will have on more mundane but life-changing opportunities the program granted him, like the ability to obtain a driver\u2019s license. (A spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Security wrote in an email that DACA recipients\u2019 licenses would expire along with their participation in the program.) </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But more than that, he\u2019s concerned about the impact the decision will have on his mother. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI wonder what my mom is thinking,\u201d Luis said. \u201cI talk to her and she\u2019s crying\u2026 I am in college and so is my mom every single day I\u2019m in class because I have her in my heart. My family trusted. And now the entire nation has been betrayed.\u201d </span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeland Security officials insist that they will not use the information provided by DACA recipients against them to pursue deportation orders. Those who participated in the program gave their information to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that processes applications to obtain legal residency or to obtain American citizenship. That agency is separate from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which carries out deportation policy. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But both agencies belong to DHS, leading to unease among the program\u2019s recipients that their trust of federal authorities may backfire on them. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s announcement that the Trump administration would end DACA, Homeland Security officials told reporters that USCIS will not share information with ICE, unless they had a compelling reason. \u201cIn instances of criminality or law enforcement, we will use all of our law enforcement databases,\u201d one of the department\u2019s senior officials said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A statement posted on the DHS website noted that the information-sharing policy between the department\u2019s agencies could </span><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/frequently-asked-questions-rescission-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">change without warning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis policy, which may be modified, superseded, or rescinded at any time without notice, is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter,\u201d the statement reads. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vagueness of those assertions offers little assurance to the individuals concerned about what Tuesday\u2019s changes mean for themselves or their families. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, concerns about information sharing through the soon-to-be-defunct DACA program is unlikely to keep many of the program\u2019s beneficiaries quiet. </span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before the Obama administration implemented DACA, many undocumented youths had begun openly declaring their immigration status as a political act, adopting the slogan \u201cundocumented and unafraid.\u201d One of them, Cesar Vargas, became the </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/04/undocumented-law-new-york_n_7510172.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first undocumented immigrant in the state of New York to obtain a license to practice law in 2015</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> \u2015 a state court decision based partly on the fact that he had DACA.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, he practices immigration law in Staten Island. Despite concerns about information sharing between USCIS and ICE, Vargas emphasized that until it\u2019s phased out, the program continues. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI\u2019m telling clients, \u2018your information should be safe,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut don\u2019t get in trouble. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While his hard-fought ability to practice law was plunged into doubt with the Trump administration\u2019s decision, Vargas urged other Dreamers to keep publicly pushing for reform, noting like most others interviewed for this story that it was their efforts that led to the creation of DACA in the first place. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cOne of the things we try to tell people is that this is a moment not to regress back to the shadows,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cThis is a moment where we\u2019re undocumented and unafraid. Trump and [Attorney General] Jeff Sessions want us to regress back to the shadows. They tell stories that portray us as criminals and rapists. But we need to keep telling our own stories.\u201d</span></p>, <p><em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/newsletters/must-reads">Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.\xa0</a>Each Sunday, we bring you the best original reporting, long-form writing and breaking news from HuffPost and around the web, plus behind-the-scenes looks at how it\u2019s all made.

And it is cruel. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we\u2019d want our own kids to be treated. It\u2019s about who we are as a people \u2015 and who we want to be.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obama started the program in 2012 and urged undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to come forward to the government, pay a fee and undergo a background check before receiving a two-year work permit and reprieve from deportation.</span></p>, <p>He did so after legislative efforts to help Dreamers \u2015 which are being revived now because of Trump\u2019s decisions \u2015 failed multiple times, as he noted in his statement.\xa0</p>, <p>\u2033[B]ecause it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country,\u201d Obama said.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">To target hopeful young strivers who grew up here is wrong, because they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. My statement: <a href="https://t.co/TCxZdld7L4">https://t.co/TCxZdld7L4</a></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump promised during his presidential campaign to immediately end DACA, but Obama urged him not to,\xa0</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/obama-trump-think-long-hard-endangering-dreamers-n683811"><span style="font-weight: 400;">both publicly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0and in </span><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/obama-trump-dreamers-233183"><span style="font-weight: 400;">private conversations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Sessions, who<strong>\xa0</strong>supports enforcing current law through increased deportations,<strong>\xa0</strong>has opposed the DACA program since its inception under President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a> in 2012. As a senator, he helped block legislative efforts to help so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d who came to the U.S. as children.\xa0</span></p>, <p>\u201cWe are people of compassion and we are people of law,\u201d Sessions said during a speech at the Department of Justice. \u201cBut there is nothing compassionate about the failure to enforce immigration laws. ...\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">The compassionate thing to do is to end the lawlessness, enforce our laws and, if Congress chooses to make changes to those laws, to do so through the process set forth by our founders in a way that advances the interest of the American people.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p>DACA protections, which last for two years and allow Dreamers to work legally, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca" target="_blank">won\u2019t end immediately</a>. Current DACA recipients whose permits expire between now and March 5 can apply to renew them, but must submit their renewal applications by Oct. 5 or will be unable to do so. Individuals who do not currently have DACA protections cannot receive permits unless they applied to the program before Sept. 5.</p>, <p>Dreamers whose permits expire on March 6 or later will begin to lose their protections and work permits as soon as they expire, putting them at risk of deportation.</p>, <p>Trump said in a statement that he \u201cadvised the Department of Homeland Security that DACA recipients are not enforcement priorities unless they are criminals, are involved in criminal activity, or are members of a gang.\u201d</p>, <p>But losing DACA protections would nonetheless put Dreamers at risk of being sent away from the country they\u2019ve lived in since they were children.\xa0Although administration officials have said their focus is on deporting criminals, they have also made clear that no undocumented immigrant is safe from being detained or forced out of the country. That includes Dreamers, some of whom have already been locked up.\xa0</p>, <p>Department of Homeland Security officials said before the announcement that there are no plans to specifically target current DACA recipients or use their information for enforcement purposes, although they will continue to do so if needed for criminal or national security investigations.\xa0</p>, <p>The official Trump administration announcement comes on the Sept. 5 deadline set by 10 state attorneys general who <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dreamers-daca_us_59557545e4b02734df31197d">threatened legal action</a> if Trump did not announce a phaseout of DACA by that date. Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III (R)\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republians-dreamers-daca_us_59acb953e4b0dfaafcf1255c">backed off that threat last week</a>, but the others continued to demand an end to the program. The threat was not a court order, so it was not a mandate for the Trump administration to end the program ahead of a legal challenge or ruling.</p>, <p>Trump misstated the facts of the threat in a statement after Sessions\u2019 announcement. The president claimed that\xa0\u201cofficials from 10 States are suing over the program,\u201d even though they had not taken legal action and only nine of the 10 states had maintained that threat.</p>, <p>Trump <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-to-end-daca-report-politico_us_59acaa61e4b0b5e530ff6e88?6mn">decided to end</a> DACA against the wishes of Democrats and some members of his own party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-daca-dreamers_us_59a86e41e4b0dfaafceef55a">said Congress</a> should get the chance to pass a bill.</p>, <p>The president said on Tuesday afternoon that he hoped Congress would move forward to help Dreamers, although he said nothing about what he thinks they should do.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly,\u201d Trump said in the White House. \u201cAnd I can tell you, speaking to members of Congress, they want to be able to do something and do it right. ...\xa0I think it\u2019s going to work out very well and long-term, it\u2019s going to be the right solution.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of Trump\u2019s announcement, a number of Republicans <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republians-dreamers-daca_us_59acb953e4b0dfaafcf1255c">said they would be willing</a> to support protections for Dreamers that Democrats have attempted to get through Congress multiple times.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Republicans opposed those past measures, including the Dream Act, a bill first introduced in 2001 that would grant legal status to some undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The bill has a small number of Republican supporters, but the White House </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dream-act_us_5970b9a4e4b062ea5f901576"><span style="font-weight: 400;">immediately shot it down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it was re-introduced in the Senate in July. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans are pushing what they say is a more conservative version of the Dream Act, called the Recognizing America\u2019s Children Act, or RAC Act, which would offer a path to citizenship to a smaller category of Dreamers.</span>\xa0</p>, <p>Sessions\u2019 speech only mentioned one piece of legislation specifically: the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-cotton-perdue-legal-immigration_us_5981eb6ae4b09d24e99482a8">RAISE Act</a>, which would slash legal immigration numbers and has nothing to do with Dreamers. His remarks more broadly made the case against offering Dreamers legal status, something he has opposed many times throughout his career.\xa0</p>, <p>Sessions said that DACA \u201cdenied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs\u201d \u2015 an argument that could also be applied to legislation that allows Dreamers to stay in the country and work legally. He claimed that a surge in unaccompanied minors at the southwest U.S. border was also due to DACA, although those children were ineligible for the program. Sessions also said that the U.S. \u201cmust set and enforce a limit on how many immigrants we admit each year.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThis does not mean they are bad people or that our nation disrespects or demeans them in any way,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIt means we are properly enforcing our laws as Congress has passed them.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s statement similarly emphasized other changes to the immigration system. Like Sessions, he cited the RAISE Act and said his \u201cfirst and highest priority in advancing immigration reform must be to improve jobs, wages and security for American workers and their families.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, we will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion \u2013 but through the lawful Democratic process \u2013 while at the same time ensuring that any immigration reform we adopt provides enduring benefits for the American citizens we were elected to serve,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe must also have heart and compassion for unemployed, struggling, and forgotten Americans.\u201d</p>, <p><em>This story has been updated with Donald Trump\u2019s statements.</em></p>]

A sellout,\u201d he added.\xa0</p>, <p>Harvey said he first met with Trump after he said his business partner received \u201ca call from the Obama transition team, who said that the Trump transition team would like to set up a meeting.\u201d\xa0He said yes \u2015 but the meeting was also to be held around Harvey\u2019s 60th birthday celebration which was hosted on a boat. So, his wife Marjorie Harvey, suggested he deliberately miss the meeting.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cMy wife says, \u2019Steve, just take off [and skip the meeting].

He recalled how he told Trump about potentially working with Ben Carson, who the president appointed to lead the department of Housing and Urban Development, to help identify ways he could help transform closing schools into \u201cvision centers and teach STEM and computers and coding.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Harvey said he has since been to HUD twice and that he\u2019s met with Carson. \u201cWe\u2019re actually trying to get it started,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully before the year goes out, we\u2019ll be making the announcement about the first vision center.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Harvey, who was pictured with Trump immediately following their meeting, drew ire from critics who called out the disrespect and shame they felt in seeing him, a black man, be so willing to work with a man who has consistently neglected and disrespected the black community.\xa0</p>, <p>Harvey himself <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmSteveHarvey/status/820007199917375489" target="_blank">released a statement in January</a> as the outrage began to bubble up, explaining then why he met with the President and affirming that \u201che would sit with Trump anytime.\u201d \xa0</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">My meeting with <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a> ... <a href="https://t.co/Tz2O2W3a5n">pic.twitter.com/Tz2O2W3a5n</a></p>, <p>A fancy birthday boat ride doesn\u2019t sound half bad, after all.\xa0</p>]

Overdose deaths take time to confirm, and it\u2019s possible the new report\u2019s numbers could change, but the apparent improvement comes amid growing use of the overdose reversal drug naloxone \u2015 lending credence to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0424-naloxone.html" target="_blank">public health theory</a> that increased access to naloxone helps prevent opioid deaths.</p>, <p>\u201cThe increased use of naloxone in New York State reflects both the ongoing opioid epidemic as well as increased access to this life-saving medication,\u201d Jill Montag, a state health department spokeswoman, told HuffPost in an email. \u201cCounty health departments \u2015 as well as treatment programs, community-based organizations and public safety agencies \u2015 have taken critical roles in working with the state to expand this capacity.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Montag noted that New York plans to continue expanding access to the medication, via a <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-no-cost-or-lower-cost-naloxone-available-pharmacies-across-new-york" target="_blank">naloxone copay assistance program</a> that offers up to $40 in copay assistance to people with health insurance. (Those without insurance can get naloxone for free through a registered overdose prevention program.)</p>, <p>\u201cThese findings are consistent with the increasingly definitive medical and public health evidence that expanded access to naloxone for first responders, community and family members, as well as those using opioids, saves lives,\u201d Dr. Peter Friedmann, associate dean for research at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and chief research officer at the nonprofit Baystate Health, told HuffPost.</p>, <p>Indeed, the new numbers track with previous research, including a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper released in February, which found that between 1999 and 2014, adopting naloxone access laws was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/naloxone-opioid-epidemic_us_58b5c11fe4b0a8a9b7869e6c" target="_blank">associated with a 9 to 11 percent reduction in opioid deaths</a>. (The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal.)</p>, <p>New York City\u2019s numbers complicate the picture, however. The state report does not include the city\u2019s overdose death figures, but the New York City Health Department confirmed that unintentional overdose deaths in NYC\xa0<a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief89.pdf" target="_blank">rose from 937 in 2015 to 1,374 in 2016</a>. More than 80 percent of those deaths involved an opioid.</p>, <p>\u201cNew York City has had high rates of opioid overdose deaths in the Bronx, and particularly the South Bronx,\u201d an NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene spokesperson told HuffPost. \u201cNonetheless, similar to other parts of the city, state and country, the Bronx has seen steep increases in opioid-involved overdose deaths since 2010, with sharp increases from 2015 to 2016. If the South Bronx were a state, it would have the second highest overdose rate after West Virginia.\u201d</p>, <p>This increase comes despite the city\u2019s robust naloxone program. In March, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/nyregion/mayors-plan-to-fight-addiction-focuses-on-healing.html?_r=0" target="_blank">$38 million plan to fight opioid addiction</a> and overdose, including a commitment to distributing 100,000 naloxone kits per year. According to the new state report, emergency medical services in New York City administered the overdose reversal drug 5,088 times in 2015 and 7,667 times last year.\xa0</p>, <p>On the national level, news about the opioid crisis has been bleak in recent years. In 2015, more than 50,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, with overdose deaths <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drug-overdose-deaths-hit-record-high_us_5989d195e4b0a66b8baed05e" target="_blank">outpacing historical epidemics</a> like HIV and firearm deaths during their deadliest years.\xa0</p>]

And long term it\u2019s going to be the right solution.\u201d</p>, <p>William Gheen of Americans for Legal Immigration, which advocates for restricting immigration into this country, was not happy. \u201cHe\u2019s implying that Congress should pass amnesty instead of him.\u201d</p>, <p>Unfortunately for Trump, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/immigration">immigration</a> hard-liners make up a disproportionate chunk of that 35 percent of the nation that still approves of his job performance.</p>, <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what those stadiums full of people wanted,\u201d Gheen said. \u201cDonald Trump is letting a lot of Americans down today.\u201d</p>, <p>Gheen and others who want to limit immigration point to a Phoenix rally on Aug. 31, 2016, when Trump gave his word on ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.</p>, <p>\u201cWe will immediately terminate President Obama\u2019s two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants,\u201d Trump said, referring to DACA and a related program that was blocked by the courts.</p>, <p>But almost exactly three years earlier, Trump met with a handful of so-called Dreamers \u2015 named for the acronym of the failed legislation that sought to protect them \u2015 during which he <a href="http://nbclatino.com/2013/08/22/donald-trump-tells-immigrant-advocates-youve-convinced-me/">reportedly told them</a> that they had persuaded him on the issue. And since taking office, Trump has on numerous occasions talked about his <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-press-conference-dreamers-heart-235103" target="_blank">\u201cheart\u201d and his \u201ccompassion\u201d</a> toward the DACA enrollees.</p>, <p>These conflicting statements follow a pattern of Trump\u2019s personality, in which appears to want to please or at least avoid a confrontation with whatever group he happens to be speaking to at the moment.</p>, <p>When meeting with the DACA recipients, he told them what they wanted to hear. Then, in front of a rally crowd, he told them what he thought they wanted to hear.</p>, <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like conflict,\u201d said one Republican consultant close to the Trump White House, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly about the president.</p>, <p>So, the consultant said, after having promised his voting base one thing and DACA kids the opposite, Trump decided to offload the issue onto Congress, which should have dealt with it in the first place.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is checkmate for him,\u201d the adviser said of Trump\u2019s strategy, adding that Trump has many times made clear he empathizes with the plight of the DACA recipients. \u201cHe thinks more of the Dreamers than he does of Republican leaders in Congress.\u201d</p>, <p>That punt-to-Congress tactic was accepted Tuesday, if not necessarily embraced, by some of DACA\u2019s most strident critics. Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform also wished Trump had acted sooner. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back and change the past. The announcement today is that it\u2019s going to be phased out.\u201d Mehlman added that he expects Trump to force Democrats to \u201ccome to the table\u201d and work to fix border security and eliminate the benefits of coming to this country illegally. \u201cAnd then we can figure out how to deal with this.\u201d</p>, <p>But to Gheen, the fact that he and his group have to deal with the issue at all with Trump in the Oval Office is maddening.</p>, <p>\u201cWe\u2019re miffed now that we\u2019re having to fight Trump\u2019s amnesty. Those are two powerful words that we never thought we\u2019d have to put together: Trump possessive \u2018s\u2019 amnesty,\u201d Gheen said.</p>]

At one point in 2010, MSHA even <a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20170902/trump-nominates-former-coal-exec-to-run-msha" target="_blank">threatened</a> to put one of Rhino\u2019s mines on its list of egregious safety lawbreakers. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven years later, Zatezalo is now President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-puts-former-coal-executive-in-charge-of-mine-safety_us_59ab5f46e4b0354e440ad7e1">nominee to run MSHA</a>. Zatezalo told HuffPost on Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t see any problem with a former industry executive serving as the top cop responsible for making sure miners are protected by their employers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d he said of concerns that he may be too cozy with coal operators. \u201cPeople can say what they\u2019re going to say. Actions speak louder than words.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he\u2019s confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, Zatezalo would be just the latest business-friendly official installed in Trump\u2019s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency_us_5878ad15e4b0b3c7a7b0c29c" target="_blank">deregulation-happy administration</a>. And like many of the appointees before him, Zatezalo has a resume that appears better suited to an industry trade group than a watchdog government agency.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he started out as a rank-and-file union miner, Zatezalo climbed his way to the top of the industry over the decades, eventually helming Lexington, Kentucky-based Rhino. He also served stints as chairman of the Kentucky and Ohio coal lobbying groups.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zatezalo, who retired from his Rhino post in 2014, told the Wheeling Intelligencer that coal executives including Murray Energy CEO Bob Murray \u2015 a major Trump donor and longtime critic of the federal government \u2015 essentially <a href="https://www.theintelligencer.net/news/top-headlines/2017/09/meet-wheelings-david-zatezalo-president-trumps-nominee-for-msha-chief/" target="_blank">recruited him for the MSHA job</a>.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of people in the industry I don\u2019t know, and people said, \u2018You\u2019d be great for that position. I\u2019m going to call [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell and tell him he needs to support you for this,\u2019\u201d Zatezalo told the paper.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSHA was </span><a href="https://www.msha.gov/about/history"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created in 1977</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the wake of deadly mining disasters to enforce the rights of miners and to make sure they aren\u2019t put in harm\u2019s way. The agency is responsible for inspecting all of the nation\u2019s mines (not just coal), identifying workplace hazards and fining operators when they\u2019re breaking the law. MSHA differs from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in that it\u2019s tasked with protecting workers in a single, dangerous line of work. <strong>\xa0</strong></span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it worries mine safety advocates that, assuming Zatezalo wins Senate confirmation, the agency\u2019s reins will be handed to a former executive. Many coal operators view MSHA\u2019s inspections and citations as an annoyance that slow down production and cost them money. Zatezalo\u2019s friend Murray, for instance, has referred to MSHA inspections as \u201d</span><a href="http://blogs.wvgazettemail.com/coaltattoo/2016/08/11/bob-murray-msha-inspections-total-harassment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">total harassment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cYou always want to give someone the benefit of the doubt, but history tells us that people chosen from industry typically don\u2019t do a good job,\u201d Tony Oppegard, a Kentucky lawyer who represents miners in safety cases, told HuffPost. \u201cI don\u2019t expect him to be a zealous advocate of mine safety. I don\u2019t think Trump\u2019s team would have chosen him if that was the case.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Zatezalo was running Rhino in 2011, the company had to pay $44,500 in fines after a foreman was killed when a wall collapsed in a West Virginia mine. The same year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSHA accused Rhino employees at a Kentucky mine of tipping off workers underground when agency inspectors were about to make their rounds. As the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported, the agency went so far as to seek a </span><a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/20170902/trump-nominates-former-coal-exec-to-run-msha"><span style="font-weight: 400;">court injunction against Rhino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the practice.</span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSHA is required by law to inspect every workplace in its purview multiple times each year. Absent action by Congress, that won\u2019t change even with an MSHA chief who wanted to scale back enforcement and be a friend to industry. But there are other ways an agency leader could soften regulations and go easy on mining companies.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celeste Monforton, an occupational health expert and former MSHA employee, said the MSHA chief could alter the criteria that lands a mine on the agency\u2019s \u201cpattern of violations\u201d list. That\u2019s the list that Zatezalo\u2019s company nearly wound up on in 2010.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monforton said the agency\u2019s leader could also decide not to pursue high-dollar penalties against mine operators, or go easy on them in settlement talks over safety violations. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWhat will his focus be \u2015 will it be on miners and mine safety, or will he have a philosophy that MSHA is there to help mine operators, provide a lot of compliance assistance, and be wary of taking a tough stand?\u201d she asked.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he\u2019s confirmed, Zatezalo will be coming to MSHA at a time when black lung cases are </span><a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/12/15/505577680/advanced-black-lung-cases-surge-in-appalachia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spiking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in much of Appalachia. It\u2019s up to MSHA to make sure mine operators are taking the right precautions to limit coal dust, excessive levels of which can destroy miners\u2019 lungs.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monforton said there is still much that MSHA can do to protect miners from lung illnesses, including strengthening the regulations for silica dust, which comes from cut rock.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said she hopes Zatezalo would remember his experience as a rank-and-file miner, rather than his role as an executive, in regulating mine safety.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cHe has seen first-hand the tragedy and the suffering that goes on with people who develop black lung and silicosis,\u201d Monforton said. \u201cIt really would be a way for him to make a positive mark.\u201d</span></p>]

They are willing to vote for protecting so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2015 but not without getting something in exchange for it. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cHopefully there will be some give and take and we can accomplish something,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said, suggesting Democrats could support efforts to boost border security.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that his administration </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with enforcement to begin in six months. That time period gives Congress time to pass its own measures to allow undocumented young people to stay in the country, something that a majority of Americans support. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Republicans in Congress have previously opposed such measures. A majority of them voted against past versions of the Dream Act, a stand-alone bill that would provide legal status to young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Some GOP senators voted for a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included measures for Dreamers in 2013, but also would have increased border security and included other enforcement measures. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of the sponsors of the current iteration of the Dream Act, argued during a press conference on Tuesday that lawmakers\xa0\u201cdon\u2019t have that luxury right now\u201d of taking the time to pass another comprehensive bill, given the six-month time limit. Only </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1615/cosponsors?r=2&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22dream+act%22%5D%2C%22party%22%3A%22Republican%22%7D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are currently co-sponsoring the Dream Act: Graham, Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). Gardner announced his support on Tuesday evening. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another possibility for stand-alone legislation is the Recognizing America\u2019s Children Act, or RAC Act, that Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) plans to introduce in the Senate soon.\xa0The RAC Act in the form already introduced in the House would grant legal status to certain young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. at age 15 or younger before 2012; the 2017 Dream Act would be open to individuals who came before the age of 18 and were in the U.S. since four years prior to the bill taking effect.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tillis indicated on Tuesday that his bill is meant to pass on its own \u2015 he told reporters that although \u201cwe need border security measures, it\u2019s a different bill going through Congress.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe bottom line of it is, I don\u2019t think DACA as a clean bill can get through the Congress by itself,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa)\xa0</span><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/05/trump-daca-dreamers-congress-response-242336"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a call with reporters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday, according to Politico. He added that this was an \u201copportunity for compromise between people that want DACA plus a lot of other things dealing with legal immigration, and I suppose even some things dealing with illegal immigration, that can probably be packaged together.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans want to pair protections for Dreamers with cutting legal immigration, which Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) is pushing through in a bill called the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-cotton-perdue-legal-immigration_us_5981eb6ae4b09d24e99482a8">RAISE Act</a>. That legislation \u2015 which has nothing to do with Dreamers \u2015 was the only specific measure that Trump or Attorney General Jeff Sessions mentioned on Tuesday while announcing the DACA decision. The RAISE Act would face opposition not just from Democrats, but some Republicans as well. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump hasn\u2019t actually said what he specifically wants Congress to do about Dreamers, although the White House previously indicated he </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dream-act_us_5970b9a4e4b062ea5f901576"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wouldn\u2019t sign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a stand-alone bill like the Dream Act. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly,\u201d the president said on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cAnd I can tell you, speaking to members of Congress, they want to be able to do something and do it right. And really, we have no choice, we have to be able to do something, and I think it\u2019s going to work out very well.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if enough Republicans ultimately come out in support of a stand-alone Dream Act, it\u2019s no sure bet that all Democrats would join them. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who helped defeat a similar measure in 2013, said Tuesday he opposed the president\u2019s \u201cill-informed\u201d decision to rescind DACA. But the vulnerable red state Democrat, who is facing a tough re-election fight in 2018, would not say whether he would vote to provide legal status to Dreamers in the future.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI don\u2019t know. It depends on what it is,\u201d Tester said, adding that Congress now had an \u201copportunity\u201d to tackle comprehensive immigration reform, which he supports. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are unlikely to compromise on funding Trump\u2019s border wall, some said. But they might be willing to accept other measures. Graham, when touting the Dream Act, noted that his Democratic colleagues had voted for border security and enforcement measures as part of the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIn order to get 68 votes in the Senate, I swallowed hard,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top champion of the Dream Act, said at the press conference with Graham of the 2013 bill. \u201cI\u2019ve been open to border security issues, I continue to be open to them. The wall, though, is a wall too far.\u201d </span></p>]

While DACA will officially end in six months, it\u2019s now up to the House and Senate to formulate a solution to protect the nearly<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b?t6"> 800,000 Dreamers.\xa0</a></p>, <p>\xa0And Vargas is adamant about pushing Congress to step up and <a href="https://twitter.com/joseiswriting/status/905085547865145345" target="_blank">serve DACA </a>recipients. In order for that to happen, the journalist told HuffPost, awareness must be spread regarding the program\u2019s payoffs for both undocumented and documented Americans alike.<br/><br/>\u201cDon\u2019t give up. We\u2019re with you. The majority of the country is also outraged right now and together, we are powerful,\u201d Vargas, who\u2019s Filipino-American, told HuffPost of his message to Dreamers. \u201cWe will fight for a new \u2015 and maybe even better \u2015 solution. We\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</p>, <p>Vargas called on local media outlets and allies to highlight the contributions DACA recipients in their own communities bring to society. And the activist said that there are many of them. In the <a href="https://www.teachforamerica.org/top-stories/daca-dream-act-how-you-can-stand-tfa-dreamer-teachers-and-undocumented-students" target="_blank">Teach For America program</a> alone, there are almost 200 educators and alumni enrolled in the DACA program who serve more than 10,000 students.\xa0A significant portion of recipients also work in healthcare with about 21 percent working in educational and health services,\xa0a<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2016/10/18/146290/new-study-of-daca-beneficiaries-shows-positive-economic-and-educational-outcomes/" target="_blank">\xa0survey indicated</a>\xa0\u2015 a particularly noteworthy statistic as the U.S. faces a projected shortage of between <a href="https://news.aamc.org/press-releases/article/workforce_projections_03142017/" target="_blank">40,800 and 104,900 doctors, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges</a>.</p>, <p>\u201cOne day, that teacher won\u2019t be able to show up for her kids. That nurse, who might be the only ray of sunshine in one of their patient\u2019s lives, won\u2019t be able to provide them comfort,\u201d Vargas, who co-founded nonprofit <a href="https://defineamerican.com/about/" target="_blank">Define American,</a> said of the consequences of ending the program. \u201cWe have brilliant students who won\u2019t be able to finish out their studies and give back the fruits of their knowledge.</p>, <p>The journalist also pointed out Dreamers are a benefit to the economy as a whole. More than <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2017/08/28/437956/daca-recipients-economic-educational-gains-continue-grow/" target="_blank">90 percent</a> of the group is currently enrolled in school or employed, according to the Center for American Progress.

It\u2019s why Vargas stresses the importance of grassroots efforts to show the true value of Dreamers.\xa0</p>, <p>While Trump\u2019s decision makes this a difficult time for anyone benefitting from DACA, Vargas remains hopeful. And He has a few words for anyone looking to create change following Tuesday\u2019s announcement:</p>, <p>\u201cThere is so much information out there about what DACA actually is and the benefits it provides. We need to keep speaking up and showing up. This fight isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p>]

Luther Strange (R-Ala.) is calling on the Senate to lower its threshold for ending a filibuster from 60 votes to 51 votes \u2015 a simple majority \u2015 in order for the GOP to more easily advance President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s legislative agenda.</p>, <p>The proposal, which <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/344294-trump-urges-senate-gop-to-end-filibuster-for-future-votes" target="_blank">Trump backs</a> but the Senate\u2019s Republican leadership opposes, also appears aimed at buttressing Strange\u2019s chances of holding onto his office this year \u2015 even as it puts him at odds with his main supporter in that bid, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).</p>, <p>Strange, who since February has been temporarily filling the seat fellow Republican Jeff Sessions gave up to serve as Trump\u2019s attorney general, is struggling to fend off a tough challenge from Roy Moore in a special GOP Senate primary on Sept. 26. The victor is virtually assured of winning the Dec. 12 special election in heavily Republican Alabama.</p>, <p>Moore, a staunch social conservative and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice known nationally for his refusal to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Judicial Building, has cast himself as the anti-establishment candidate in the race.</p>, <p>The controversial provocateur has portrayed Strange as beholden to \u201cWashington elitists,\u201d and has attacked him for the receiving financial backing from McConnell and his allies. Moore\u2019s supporters include Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist in the White House who has returned to his old job of running the right-wing Breitbart News website.</p>, <p>A <a href="http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/08/luther_strange_roy_moore_in_vi.html" target="_blank">survey</a>\xa0conducted last week by Harper Polling found Strange, 64, and Moore, 70, locked in a virtual tie in the primary race.</p>, <p>In his call for the Senate to, in essence, end the ability of the chamber\u2019s minority party to block legislation, Strange noted that Alabamians \u201coverwhelmingly supported\u201d Trump in the 2016 presidential election.</p>, <p>They \u201cexpect his agenda to be enacted by Congress,\u201d Strange <a href="https://www.strange.senate.gov/content/strange-sides-president-trump-filibuster-rule" target="_blank">said in a letter</a> to McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cBut, because of obstructionist tactics by Democrats and broken promises by some Republicans, very little legislation is even making it to the Senate floor.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWhile I had hoped that Republicans and Democrats would work together to accomplish the will of the American people, it has become obvious that politics and self-preservation will continue to rule the day,\u201d\xa0he said.</p>, <p>Strange added that \u201cconversations with the president\u201d led him to change his position on the filibuster as \u201cthe only way we will be able to build the border wall, rein in sanctuary cities, defund Planned Parenthood, and give the American people real tax relief.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump backed Strange in the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-senate-republican-primary-luther-strange_us_598b4f06e4b0449ed5076e22" target="_blank">first round</a> of the nomination race in a 10-candidate primary on Aug. 15. Moore, with 39 percent of the vote, and Strange, with 33 percent, were the two top finishers and headed into this month\u2019s runoff because neither exceeded the 50-percent mark.</p>, <p>Strange got a \u201cTrump bump\u201d in the initial vote, said Vince Gawronski, a professor of political science at Birmingham-Southern College In Alabama.</p>, <p>Trump, though, has not actively touted Strange since then. And <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/04/alabama-senate-race-special-election-breitbart-242307" target="_blank">reports have surfaced </a>that some conservatives are urging him to stay silent.</p>, <p>Strange, meanwhile, has benefited throughout his campaign from millions of dollars spent on his behalf by a McConnell-aligned super PAC, which makes his push to revise the filibuster rule awkward for both men. McConnell and other Senate GOP leaders prefer retaining the 60-vote requirement to end a filibuster as a protection for whenever control of the chamber reverts to the Democrats.</p>, <p>Strange\u2019s call for the rule change follows reports of a pair of key endorsements of Moore this week.</p>, <p>Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) \u2015 whose daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, serves as the White House press secretary, announced his support for Moore on Monday.</p>, <p>Huckabee <a href="http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2017/09/mike_huckabee_makes_endorsemen.html" target="_blank">said on his website</a>\xa0his decision \u201chas nothing to do with specific displeasure\u201d with Strange. But, Huckabee said, \u201cif the \u2018power brokers\u2019 in D.C. are as desperate as they seem to be to keep Judge Moore from joining them, then they must fear that he can\u2019t be counted on to \u2018join the club.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>The Senate Conservatives Fund, which supported Rep. Mo Brooks in the first-round primary, also backed Moore on Monday.</p>, <p>The group\u2019s president, Ken Cuccinelli, <a href="http://mailchi.mp/senateconservatives/support-roy-moore-for-us-senate?e=f50cf9b840" target="_blank">in a statement</a> praised Moore as \u201ca political outsider who isn\u2019t afraid to stand up to the liberals in his own party.\u201d</p>, <p>He also said the race\u2019s outcome would \u201cimpact\u201d McConnell\u2019s \u201cfuture as the Republican leader in the Senate.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cNothing would destabilize McConnell more than losing the Alabama Senate race after spending\u201d millions \u201cto crush conservatives\u201d in the state, Cuccinelli said.</p>, <p>Brooks, who finished third in the first-round primary with 20 percent of the vote, has so far declined to make an endorsement in the runoff.</p>]

Here are the components of North Korea\u2019s developing nuclear program, and the West\u2019s efforts to stop it.</p>, <p>North Korea has been working to acquire a functional, deliverable nuclear weapon for decades. Those aspirations <a href="http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/north-korea/">began during the rule of former Supreme Leader Kim Il Sung</a> at the close of World War II and began to take shape under the reign of his son, Kim Jong Il, who first tested a nuclear weapon in 2006.</p>, <p class="p1">As New York Times reporter David Sanger explained in <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/03/29/521909787/the-u-s-has-an-active-cyber-war-underway-to-thwart-the-north-korean-nuclear-thre">an interview with NPR\u2019s Dave Davies</a>\xa0in late March:\xa0</p>, <p class="p2">\u201cKim Il Sung remembers that General [Douglas] MacArthur, during the Korean War, wanted to use nuclear weapons against North Korea and China. He was stopped from doing this. But it made a very big impression on Mr. Kim, and he knew that North Korea, to survive and deter attack, needed to have this capability itself. And he\u2019s the one, the grandfather of the current North Korean leader, who started down this path.\u201d</p>, <p class="p1">The North was able to purchase much of its initial nuclear technology from one of the founders of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear program and bought centrifuges to enrich uranium from Libya.\xa0</p>, <p class="p1">The North is in possession of <a href="https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2017/global-nuclear-weapons-modernization-remains-priority" target="_blank">up to 20 nuclear warheads</a>, according to an annual report released this week by the <a href="https://www.sipri.org/" target="_blank">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a>.</p>, <p>North Korea has so far conducted six nuclear weapons tests, all at an underground test site in the country\u2019s northeast called Punggye-ri. Those blasts, which began in 2006, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons-tests.html">have only gotten stronger</a> over the past decade as the North hones its weapons program.</p>, <p class="p1">As The New York Times noted, the first such test, conducted by current leader\u2019s father, Kim Jong Il, had a yield of less than 1 kiloton, or the equivalent of 1,000 tons of TNT. The second, conducted three years later, clocked in at 2.35 kilotons. The North\u2019s most recent test was the strongest ever.

And on Aug. 28, it <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-missile-japan_us_59a4874fe4b050afa90c1eab" target="_blank">fired</a> an intermediate range missile over northern Japan.</p>, <p class="p1">Pyongyang is flexing muscles that experts say are getting bigger.</p>, <p>North Korea\u2019s nuclear aspirations, experts say, hinge on Kim\u2019s desire to retain control of the isolated nation.</p>, <p class="p1">\u201cAbove all else, North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is about security,\u201d John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37321686">told the BBC</a> last September. \u201cIt is, by their estimation, the only reliable guarantee of the country\u2019s basic sovereignty, of the Communist regime\u2019s control, and of the rule of Kim Jong-un.\u201d</p>, <p class="p1">Sanger, the Times reporter, echoed that view on \u201cFresh Air\u201d:</p>, <p class="p3">\u201cIf you consider your objectives to be to assure regime survival, to make sure that North Korea remains the Kim family\u2019s personal fiefdom, then they\u2019ve pursued a pretty rational strategy, one in which loyalty is above all, in which even members of the family who challenge the leadership end up getting executed. And under that structure, the North Koreans, for an unstable, irrational regime have played a pretty good game since 1953.\u201d</p>, <p>Kim has continued weapons tests despite increasingly strict condemnations from the international community. In January, the United Nations imposed its \u201c<a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12603.doc.htm">toughest ever</a>\u201d sanctions on the country in an attempt to stifle the program.\xa0It issued its latest round of sanctions restricting foreign trade and exports of certain goods on Aug. 5, after the second ICBM test.</p>, <p>But such actions have failed in the past.</p>, <p>Last<strong>\xa0</strong>September, former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the North\u2019s actions in recent years had led to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/world/asia/north-korea-ban-ki-moon.html" target="_blank">unprecedented state of turmoil</a> in the region.</p>, <p>\u201cNever in the past have I ever seen such kind of heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Ban said.</p>, <p>In light of Sunday\u2019s test, South Korea has called for the\xa0<a data-beacon-parsed="true" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41139445" target="_blank">\u201cstrongest possible\u201d response</a>\xa0from the international community, including new sanctions to \u201ccompletely isolate\u201d Pyongyang.</p>, <p>Trump tweeted Sunday morning that the hermit kingdom\u2019s \u201cwords and actions continue to be <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/904305644651634688" target="_blank">very hostile and dangerous</a> to the United States.\u201d He also continued his criticism of China\u2019s role in the defusing the situation, tweeting Beijing is \u201ctrying to help but with <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/904307898213433344" target="_blank">little success</a>.\u201d</p>, <p class="p1">Under Obama, the United States tread carefully and refrained from any direct action against Kim\u2019s regime. As a member of the United Nations Security Council, the U.S.\xa0helped increase sanctions against North Korea following its September 2016 nuclear test.</p>, <p class="p1">\u201cThe United States is realistic about what this resolution will achieve. No resolution in New York will likely, tomorrow, persuade Pyongyang to cease its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons,\u201d former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear-un-idUSKBN13P1TF" target="_blank">said at the time</a>. She added that such sanctions impose \u201cunprecedented costs on the [North Korean]<strong>\xa0</strong>regime for defying this council\u2019s demands.\u201d</p>, <p class="p1">The U.S. also reportedly was engaged in more covert operations. Sanger and his colleague William Broad reported last March that the Obama administration had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/world/asia/north-korea-missile-program-sabotage.html">working to sabotage North Korea\u2019s missile program for years</a>\xa0with cyber operations. Such initiatives, the pair wrote, may have derailed components inside the missiles either before or shortly after they were launched.</p>, <p class="p1">While evidence is circumstantial, Sanger said that in the course of his reporting the Times noticed some missiles, including the intermediate-range Musudan, had a failure rate of 88 percent.</p>, <p class="p1">\u201cThis for a country that hired a lot of former Soviet scientists after the Berlin Wall fell and after the Soviet Union dissolved, brought them to Pyongyang, bought a lot of their technology and in their early days had a very high success rates with the North Korean missile program because they were basing it on experiences that the Soviets and later Russia had had. And suddenly, their failure rate soared.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p class="p1">Despite condemnation from the U.N. and the West, Kim has shown no willingness to halt his country\u2019s weapons program. Trump promised on the campaign trail to rein\xa0<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/816068355555815424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2017%2F01%2Ftrump-taunts-north-korea-twitter-chaos-ensues" target="_blank">in the hermit nation</a>, but faces few good options to do so.</p>, <p class="p1">Observers looked at the first meeting between Trump and Xi in early April for possible signs of the administration\u2019s North Korea strategy.</p>, <p class="p1">China could play a significant role in motivating Pyongyang to reverse course.

Whitford</a>, a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-gerrymandering-case_us_59442033e4b01eab7a2d7ccd" target="_blank">potentially monumental case</a> the Supreme Court is set to hear on Oct. 3. The nation\u2019s highest court has never said whether an electoral map, drawn by state lawmakers every 10 years \u2015 often by the party in power \u2015 can be unconstitutional simply for favoring one party too much over the other.</p>, <p>The Supreme Court could make such a determination in the Wisconsin case, which could remake American politics by requiring states to draw maps that put lawmakers in more competitive races.</p>, <p>In the brief, McCain and Whitehouse said the case \u201cimplicates the effective functioning of American representative democracy.\u201d</p>, <p>Redrawing electoral maps to weaken the electoral influence of a particular group, often called gerrymandering, can now be done with extreme sophistication, using algorithms and complex software, the senators wrote.</p>, <p>\u201cThis new breed of \u2018bulk\u2019 partisan gerrymandering distorts statewide votes, systematically diluting the effect of votes based on political affiliation and leading to the election of congressional and state legislative delegations that do not represent the will of the voters,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis practice violates \u2018the core principle of republican government, namely, that the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.\u2019\u201d</p>, <p>Both Republicans and Democrats have benefitted from gerrymandering, the brief notes.\xa0The progressive Brennan Center for Justice <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/press-release/new-report-extreme-partisan-maps-account-16-17-republican-seats-congress" target="_blank">estimates</a> that gerrymandering accounts for 16 or 17 current Republican seats in the House of Representatives.\xa0</p>, <p>In a 2004 case called <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2003/02-1580" target="_blank">Vieth v. Jubelirer</a>, the court ruled 5-4 not to strike down Pennsylvania\u2019s congressional maps as an unconstitutional gerrymander, and four justices wrote the Supreme Court couldn\u2019t even hear the case.\xa0Despite voting with the majority, however, Justice Anthony Kennedy\xa0<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/06/justice-kennedys-beauty-pageant/530790/" target="_blank">wrote that he believed</a>\xa0a standard for determining whether a map was unconstitutional could in fact exist.

But it says that affirming the ruling of the lower court that the maps in that case were unconstitutional would send a strong signal about the Supreme Court\u2019s attitude on the issue.</p>, <p>\u201cThe district court\u2019s test provides a workable framework for distinguishing between district maps drawn based on legitimate political considerations and those constituting unlawful partisan gerrymandering,\u201d the brief says. \u201cBeyond remedying the constitutional violations present in this case, affirming the district court\u2019s decision will send a clear message that partisan gerrymandering will not be tolerated.\u201d</p>, <p>In a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Gill_AmicusBrief_BipartisanLegislators_InSupportofAppellees.pdf" target="_blank">separate brief filed</a> Tuesday, 65 current and former state lawmakers (26 Republicans and 39 Democrats) from eight states also asked the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court\u2019s decision and say Wisconsin\u2019s map was unconstitutional.</p>, <p>In the brief from McCain and Whitehouse, the senators noted that\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">gerrymandering weakens confidence in the electoral system.</span></p>, <p>\u201cAmericans do not like gerrymandering.

It Wasn't.</h1>|[<p>WASHINGTON \u2015 In <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca-decision_us_59a04060e4b05710aa5bda7b?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009">rescinding a program</a> to protect young undocumented immigrants, the Trump administration insisted on Tuesday that its hands were tied by the courts. If they didn\u2019t end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued, it would inevitably be blocked by the judicial branch.</p>, <p>But in reality, the legal fate of DACA was far from inevitable. The court decision that Sessions mentioned in his announcement involved a much broader immigration program proposed by then-President Barack Obama that has never been fully judicially adjudicated.</p>, <p>\u201cOur collective wisdom is that the [DACA] policy is vulnerable to the same legal and constitutional challenges that the courts recognized with respect to the DAPA program, which was enjoined on a nationwide basis in a decision affirmed by the 5th Circuit,\u201d Sessions said Tuesday.</p>, <p>Yet the federal courts never came to a final determination on the constitutionality of DAPA, otherwise known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents program. While a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a temporary injunction on DAPA,\xa0its fate was never sealed.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than responding to some inescapable legal reasoning,\xa0the Trump administration has caved to a threat against DACA by state attorneys general \u2015 although the president said otherwise. Trump said in a statement that \u201cofficials from 10 States are suing over the program, requiring my Administration to make a decision regarding its legality.\u201d That is not true. While 10 state attorneys general said they would take legal action if Trump didn\u2019t end DACA by Sept. 5, they have not sued, and one of the 10 has actually backed off his threat. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It\u2019s pretty extraordinary for an administration to throw in the towel based on an internal assessment before a lawsuit was even filed. The Obama administration came under attack from congressional Republicans when it decided not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court. But the law still stood \u2015 and the Supreme Court eventually sided with the Obama administration\u2019s judgment.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump\u2019s statement claimed that \u201cthe Attorney General of the United States, the Attorneys General of many states, and virtually all other top legal experts have advised that the program is unlawful and unconstitutional and cannot be successfully defended in court.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There isn\u2019t really such a grand legal consensus against DACA. Just last month, 105 law professors signed an </span><a href="https://medium.com/@shobawadhia/dacas-five-year-anniversary-more-than-100-law-professors-support-legality-of-daca-74ef00e0d2cd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0explicitly stating that there was \u201cno question\u201d that DACA was \u201ca lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d</span></p>, <p>In DAPA\u2019s case, a federal judge granted a temporary injunction against the initiative going into effect in February 2015. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, a George W.

President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to end Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants brought as children to the U.S. by their parents is a major victory for Bannon and Breitbart \u2014 and they know it.</p>, <p>As Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced plans Tuesday to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program with a six-month delay on enforcement, Breitbart\u2019s chief White House correspondent celebrated:</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">\U0001f525Sessions \U0001f525going full Breitbart with this announcement</p>, <p>\u201cThis is a huge step in the right direction for the Trump administration, and for Breitbart as we cover the stories that most of the rest of the media ignore on immigration like crimes committed by illegal aliens including so-called Dreamers, the economic and cultural effects on American workers of large scale legal and illegal immigration, and the forgotten man and woman President Trump honed in on during the 2016 race and in his inauguration speech,\u201d a senior Breitbart editor who was not authorized to speak on the record told HuffPost.</p>, <p>Breitbart was a primary source of the push to repeal DACA, which covers approximately 800,000 people. The site has sometimes published multiple stories per day promoting repeal and <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/09/05/27-times-jeff-sessions-fought-for-americans-against-daca-amnesty-and-open-borders/" target="_blank">praising DACA opponents</a>, while attacking <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/08/23/democrats-dismiss-daca-offer-trumps-aides-demand-no-strings-amnesty/" target="_blank">Democrats</a> and <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/09/04/lindsey-graham-supports-legislative-solution-for-daca-recipients/" target="_blank">Republicans</a> who support the program. At one point on Tuesday, nine of the site\u2019s 10 most popular stories were about Trump\u2019s DACA repeal (or, in one case, about <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/09/04/hillary-clinton-lobbies-for-daca-as-obama-plans-rebuke/" target="_blank">Hillary Clinton\u2019s DACA support</a>). It\u2019s no surprise that Breitbart sees a victory here: The site has served for years as the most prominent platform for anti-immigration organizations and politicians to promote their views.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Start \U0001f44f serving \U0001f44f citizens \U0001f44f with \U0001f44f this \U0001f44f same \U0001f44f urgency \U0001f44f <a href="https://t.co/vZWy8bN0cs">https://t.co/vZWy8bN0cs</a></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breitbart\u2019s celebration also shows that the right-wing populist movement Bannon represents is still influential in the administration, even after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/us/politics/steve-bannon-trump-white-house.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Bannon\u2019s departure</a>. Strong supporters of these policies remain in power: Sessions, who Bannon </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sessions-trump-endorsement-bannon-2017-7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convinced to endorse Trump in 2016</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, remains in charge of the Justice Department. Stephen Miller, a former Sessions aide, is the president\u2019s top domestic policy adviser. And former Breitbart writer Julia Hahn remains in the White House working on policy with Miller. Bannon can now provide them support from his perch at Breitbart.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump\u2019s decision on DACA could result in a congressional push to pass legislation reinstating the program. But Breitbart is already planning to work to defeat any such legislative action, should it arise.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cOver the next six months as Congress considers whether to legislatively grant amnesty to the 800,000 plus illegal aliens that Obama illegally granted DACA executive amnesty to, we will be vigilant in how we cover and expose any career politicians who run counter to the will of the American voting public and the citizens of this country who very clearly stated in November 2016 that amnesty in any form is not acceptable public policy,\u201d the senior Breitbart editor told HuffPost.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of a fight against congressional Republicans who favor immigration reforms that would legalize undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. dovetails with Breitbart\u2019s larger political mission of remaking the Republican Party. The news organization, particularly under Bannon, is openly hostile to both House Speaker <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/paul-ryan" target="_blank">Paul Ryan</a> (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/mitch-mcconnell" target="_blank">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-Ky.).</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, Bannon, Sessions and Miller, then a staffer for Sessions, </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/ryan-lizza/the-rise-and-fall-of-steve-bannon" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully joined forces</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to beat a bipartisan immigration reform bill. Bannon and Miller teamed up again in 2014 to orchestrate the shock defeat of then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). Cantor\u2019s support for immigration reform, and the backing he received from Wall Street donors who supported the policy, were the main issues that brought him down.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breitbart now backs former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore in the special Republican Senate primary runoff election against Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who was appointed to fill the seat Sessions left when he became attorney general. This position puts the site at odds with Bannon\u2019s former boss, Trump, who endorsed the incumbent Strange in early August. Just as it did in Cantor\u2019s race, the website has dispatched reporter Matt Boyle to cover the final weeks of the contest. One such dispatch\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/09/04/exclusive-judge-roy-moore-embodies-jeff-sessions-i-think-i-would-have-the-same-opinion-on-immigration-trade/" target="_blank">favorably compares Moore to Sessions</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noting that their respective positions on immigration and trade are no different. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Moore-Strange primary fight is only a piece of the larger battle Breitbart is waging. The big fight is to oust Ryan from his position as House speaker and replace him with a congressman more favorable to the Breitbart agenda. </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/inside-steve-bannons-meeting-with-mark-meadows-2481771691.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported on Tuesday that Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, met with Bannon and Boyle at Breitbart\u2019s offices in Washington on Monday to discuss the caucus\u2019 plans to take control of House leadership.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meadows appeared the next day </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/breitbart/breitbart-news-daily-rep-mark-meadows-september-5-2017?in=breitbart/sets/breitbart-news-daily-190" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a guest on Breitbart\u2019s radio show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hosted by Boyle, to tell listeners how they should pressure Ryan, House Republican leadership and their own representatives. Meadows laid out the big fights to come on the debt ceiling and the budget, and urged Breitbart followers to press their lawmakers to oppose linking a debt ceiling increase to Hurricane Harvey relief funds. He called on listeners to tell lawmakers only to pass a government funding bill that would defund sanctuary cities and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/planned-parenthood" target="_blank">Planned Parenthood</a> and include money for Trump\u2019s border wall, and to put a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on the president\u2019s desk.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIf they do that, we will hopefully avoid this bloody September,\u201d Meadows concluded.</span></p>, <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Fuller contributed reporting.</span></em></p>]

The program is scheduled to end in six months, with Congress now responsible for coming up with a solution that would preserve the program\u2019s protections. The Obama-era program had protected nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants, who would be at risk for deportation if a solution cannot be reached.\xa0</p>, <p><a href="http://nakasec.org/7218" target="_blank">The National Korean American Service and Education Consortium (NAKASEC)</a> and its affiliates HANA Center, and Korean Resource Center, along with <a href="https://napawf.org/2017/09/14946/" target="_blank">The National Asian Pacific American Women\u2019s Forum (NAPAWF)</a> and many others have issued statements condemning the cancellation.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cIt is cruel and un-American to ruin the lives of young people who stepped forward in good faith to participate in a program that has proven to be successful,\u201d NAKASEC\u2019s co-director,\xa0Dae Joong Yoon, explained in a press release. \u201cThey trusted the government. Ending DACA means the country is abandoning them and all the progress we have made together.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>While youth from Latin American countries make up the majority of DACA applications, Asian-Americans make up a sizable chunk of those eligible for the immigration program. Those who were previously able to <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-process/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">request program consideration</a> included undocumented individuals under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012, who were brought the the U.S. before their 16th birthday and met another set of guidelines related to education and criminal background, among other issues. In 2016,<a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/programs/data-hub/deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca-profiles" target="_blank"> South Korea, China, India and the Philippines</a> were among the top ten countries of origin of DACA-eligible populations. The program\u2019s termination could affect tens of thousands of members of the minority group.\xa0</p>, <p>Some organizations accused the Trump administration of acting immorally,\xa0with the Asian Americans Advancing Justice organization stating that the termination of the program, which disproportionately helped immigrants and people of color, is further proof that the administration\u2019s agenda <a href="http://www.advancingjustice-alc.org/news_and_media/advancing-justice-condemns-the-administrations-termination-of-daca/" target="_blank">\u201cis rooted in hate and inhumanity.\u201d</a> And others, including NAKASEC, have challenged allies and activists alike to resist the decision and fight to protect the undocumented community whether it\u2019s through pro-bono case work, providing sanctuaries undocumented Americans, or calling members of Congress.\xa0</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p>But many also expressed fears regarding what the termination of DACA could mean for those who\u2019ve benefitted from the program. NAPAWF said it believes more ICE raids are looming. In July alone,\xa0more than <a href="http://time.com/4893074/immigration-raids-undocumented-targets/" target="_blank">650 people were arrested during a four-day spree</a>. And back in February, immigration officers and agents raided a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-mississippi-immigration-raids-20170223-story.html" target="_blank">string of Asian restaurants</a>\xa0in Mississippi,\xa0causing alarm in the state\u2019s immigrant communities.\xa0<br/><br/>\u201cWe know what is going to happen next. ICE raids and months spent in detention centers and the mass deportation of people who have only known the United States as their home,\u201d the organization wrote in a statement. \u201cWe have already seen the devastating impact of deportation on our communities, especially for AAPI women and youth. The threat of deportation tears families apart and negatively impacts their economic stability, employment, and reproductive choices.\u201d</p>, <p>Still, many are hoping Congress will step up to provide an acceptable, permanent solution for undocumented youth \u2015 something AAAJ says that the administration has failed to do.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cIt is incumbent upon our Senators and Representatives to enact a permanent legislative solution that would once and for all protect our DACA recipients and place them on a pathway to citizenship,\u201d the group said.\xa0</p>]

Harvey Took That Too.</h1>|[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HUMBLE, Texas \u2015 Mary Woods grew concerned when she took the last gallon of milk out of the fridge.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a week after Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas, slamming the eastern region of the state with torrential rains, and food supplies were running low at The Door, the only domestic violence shelter in the northern Houston area.</span></p>, <p>Woods, 52, is an advocate there. She quickly jotted down a list of highest-priority needs: eggs, bread, diapers, toilet paper, lunch meat and juice boxes.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main roads surrounding The Door flooded during the storm, stranding about 40 women and children who live there. No one could arrive or leave. As the water started to recede and roads began to clear, many stores were still closed and the shelter was in dire need of donations. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woods shared her list with the <a href="http://tcfv.org/" target="_blank">Texas Council on Family Violence</a>, a statewide coalition on domestic violence, but it had been inundated with requests. More than one-quarter of the state\u2019s domestic violence programs were in Harvey\u2019s path of destruction, and virtually all of them had suffered effects of the storm. </span></p>, <p>The shelter in Beaumont was completely underwater and possibly gone for good. Another shelter lost its back fence, compromising security. Countless others were badly damaged. Some centers tried to evacuate before the storm, but they didn\u2019t have places to send their residents. It wasn\u2019t safe to stay with family, where abusers would most certainly look. Mass evacuation shelters, like those run by Red Cross, could also be a risk. Hotels were full, and relocating to other domestic violence shelters wasn\u2019t always feasible, as most were already at capacity.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe wound up having to go further and further out [to find places to send residents],\u201d said Gloria Terry, the executive director of the coalition, noting that some people were sent as far as six hours away to find a domestic violence shelter with free beds. Other shelters, like The Door, had decided not to evacuate, believing their clients were safest remaining where they were.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry received Woods\u2019 list of needs on Saturday, as she was busy frantically assessing the needs of the 32 programs affected by the storm. She sent Woods\u2019\xa0list to several relief organizations, but most places required her to pick up the supplies herself, and she couldn\u2019t get to them. A few hours later, the request ended up in the hands of Colony Soto, a former professional wrestler who had set up a food bank at his company\u2019s training center\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Katy, Texas. </span>\xa0</p>, <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DZWrestling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domination Zone Wrestling</span></a>\xa0usually hosts men and women looking to square off WWE-style. Last week, it acted as overflow storage for the food donated to a nearby Elk\u2019s Lodge \u2015 its wrestling ring itself was surrounded by dry food, cleaning supplies and diapers. Soto told HuffPost that he\u2019d wanted to help as soon as the hurricane hit.</p>, <p>He and his helpers methodically scoured the list to see what they had before racing around the room and tossing supplies into boxes. Tuna, check. Peanut butter, check. Bleach and latex gloves, check. An hour later, two HuffPost reporters transported the supplies to The Door.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the supplies arrived, Woods was still busy dealing with damage from the days of rain Harvey dumped on the city. The back room of the 21-year-old shelter had flooded and part of the ceiling had fallen down over the front desk. Someone taped up a bed pan liner to stop the flow. Woods had spent much of the storm trying to keep water from seeping into the shelter by rolling up sheets and pressing them into the seam where the wall met the floor. Once a sheet was soaked, she\u2019d toss it in the washer and repeat. She didn\u2019t want the dirty water to make it out to the front part of the shelter, where families slept. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She prided herself on making The Door feel cozy and comfortable. It was once a residential home, but has been renovated to feature a maze of corridors that almost require a trail of breadcrumbs to navigate. It has a daycare and play room, as well as bedrooms that each house at least four women, with extra room for bassinets and baby beds. Residents are allowed to stay at least 30 days, but many remained as long as three months because it was so hard to find affordable housing.\xa0In 2016 alone, over 700 victims sought emergency shelter there. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woods, who is also a domestic violence survivor, knew how much trauma her residents were dealing even without the added stress of the storm. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cAs I told them, you have a safe place here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe may not be able to get out, but you\u2019re safe.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woods worked at The Door through both Hurricane Rita, in 2005, and Hurricane Ike, in 2008. Shelter residents had evacuated before Rita hit, along with an estimated 2.5 million other Texans. Clients ended up spending more than 24 hours stuck in a massive traffic jam on the highway. During Ike, they\u2019d decided to stay put, but the building lost power. That meant its front gate, which uses an electromagnetic lock and serves as one of the shelter\u2019s primary layers of protection, was open to anyone who wanted to walk in. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI ran out there with a bicycle lock and wrapped it around the gate,\u201d Woods said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food and medicine are the most immediate and easily met needs for domestic violence victims who end up in shelters like The Door after fleeing abusive relationships \u2015 often with just the clothes on their backs. They rely on the shelter to connect them to a range of services as they begin the complicated process of rebuilding their lives from scratch. Those resources will be harder to come by in the aftermath of Harvey, Terry said, as thousands of other Texans deal with losing their homes and belongings. (<a href="https://salsa3.salsalabs.com/o/51013/donate_page/disaster-fund" target="_blank">Donate here</a>.)\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThere was already an inadequate amount of transitional housing, but when you go from scarce to none \u2015 what do you do with that?\u201d Terry said. She noted that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lone Star Legal Aid in Houston, which assists domestic violence victims with protective orders and other legal help, </span><a href="http://m.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Displaced-by-fire-legal-aid-attorneys-shift-to-12170884.php"><span style="font-weight: 400;">burned down during the storm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also worried about the victims who may have been considering seeking help but are now scattered across the state \u2015 likely alongside those who are abusing them. </span></p>, <p>Judy Cox, executive director of the Family Time Crisis and Counseling Center, which runs The Door, said that a longtime client had recently lined up a furnished apartment for her and her five children \u2015 and now it\u2019s been flooded, as has her car. \xa0</p>, <p>\u201cShe lost it all,\u201d Cox said. \u201cIt\u2019s really devastating. I\u2019ve been in many, many hurricanes, but oh my God, this is something else.\u201d</p>, <p>Woods, who was busy taking inventory of all the new food supplies, said that domestic violence victims are resilient.</p>, <p>\u201cWhen they come in, they cry and cry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been 12 years for me, and there are still days when I cry. I think, I made it, but it\u2019s OK to cry, it\u2019s part of the healing process. It\u2019s important for me that the women understand they can make it too.\u201d</p>, <p><em>Andy Campbell contributed reporting.</em></p>]

It\u2019s about who we are as a people \u2015 and who we want to be.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obama started the program in 2012 and urged undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to come forward to the government, pay a fee and undergo a background check before receiving a two-year work permit and reprieve from deportation.</span></p>, <p>He did so after legislative efforts to help Dreamers \u2015 which are being revived now because of Trump\u2019s decisions \u2015 failed multiple times, as he noted in his statement.\xa0</p>, <p>\u2033[B]ecause it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country,\u201d Obama said.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">To target hopeful young strivers who grew up here is wrong, because they\u2019ve done nothing wrong. My statement: <a href="https://t.co/TCxZdld7L4">https://t.co/TCxZdld7L4</a></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump promised during his presidential campaign to immediately end DACA, but Obama urged him not to,\xa0</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/obama-trump-think-long-hard-endangering-dreamers-n683811"><span style="font-weight: 400;">both publicly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0and in </span><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/obama-trump-dreamers-233183"><span style="font-weight: 400;">private conversations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In his final press conference as president, Obama said he would speak out if Trump targeted Dreamers \u201cwho have grown up here and for all practical purposes are American kids and send them someplace else when they love this country; they are our kids\u2019 friends and their classmates, and are now entering into community colleges or, in some cases, serving in our military.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe notion that we would just arbitrarily, or because of politics, punish those kids when they didn\u2019t do anything wrong themselves I think would be something that would merit me speaking out,\u201d Obama said at the time.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By ending DACA, Trump dismantled one of Obama\u2019s most significant immigration policy achievements. Trump already dramatically reshaped immigration enforcement from how it was under Obama, who began his presidency with record deportation numbers before changing enforcement priorities to focus on certain undocumented immigrants over others. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump immediately eliminated those priorities as president and has detained and deported people whom Obama allowed to remain in the country if they checked in with the government or met other requirements.\xa0</span></p>, <p>Trump said that Congress should act on Dreamers, although his statements were vague and the only legislation he mentioned specifically during his statement on DACA focused on limiting legal immigration, not actually undocumented immigrants.\xa0</p>, <p>Obama said it was time for Congress to act as well.</p>, <p>\u201cNow that the White House has shifted its responsibility for these young people to Congress, it\u2019s up to Members of Congress to protect these young people and our future,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m heartened by those who\u2019ve suggested that they should. And I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel.\u201d</p>, <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden, who served with Obama,\xa0<a href="https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/posts/10154648001036104" target="_blank">similarly condemned Trump\u2019s decision</a>\xa0to end DACA.\xa0</p>, <p>\u2033[L]et\u2019s be clear: throwing [Dreamers] out is cruel,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cIt is inhumane. And it is not America. Congress and the American people now have an obligation to step up and show our neighbors that they\u2019re welcome here, in the only place they\u2019ve ever called home.\u201d</p>]

When their permits expire, DACA recipients will now be unable to work legally and could be detained and deported under Trump\u2019s efforts to expel more undocumented immigrants.</span></p>, <p>The administration\u2019s directive gives Congress six months to reach a deal to address the status of Dreamers.\xa0But so far,\xa0Republicans have offered vague proposals or prior legislative options that don\u2019t have a clear shot at passing.</p>, <p>Calling DACA a \u201cclear abuse of executive authority,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a statement that \u201cit is my hope\u201d Congress\xa0\u201cwill be able to find consensus on a permanent legislative solution.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThe president\u2019s announcement does not revoke permits immediately, and it is important that those affected have clarity on how this interim period will be carried out. At the heart of this issue are young people who came to this country through no fault of their own, and for many of them it\u2019s the only country they know,\u201d Ryan said.</p>, <p>But other than a few who have signed on to bills with Democrats that would offer legal status to Dreamers, most Republicans have obstructed immigration bills for years, and their vague statements of support for Dreamers don\u2019t mean they\u2019ll actually push for legislation that stands a chance of passing.</p>, <p>And even if they do, it\u2019s not clear that Trump, for all his calls for Congress to act, would even sign a bill to protect Dreamers without extreme conditions such as slashing legal immigration. The urgency to act is there, but so are the difficult politics of immigration that have led to past failures on bills to provide legal status to Dreamers.</p>, <p>Ahead of the announcement, Trump tweeted that Congress should \u201cget ready to do your job.\u201d</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Congress, get ready to do your job - DACA!</p>, <p>Later Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders placed the onus on Congress to find \u201ca permanent solution done through the legislative process,\u201d providing few details on what kind of bill Trump would want to sign into law.</p>, <p>She did, however, level a threat against lawmakers who can\u2019t get the job done.</p>, <p>\u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t want to do the job they were elected to do, maybe they should get out of the way and let someone else do it,\u201d she told reporters at Tuesday\u2019s White House press briefing.</p>, <p>Trump tweeted on Tuesday evening that he would revisit the issue if Congress failed to act on DACA.</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't, I will revisit this issue!</p>, <p>Many Republicans have voted in the past to end DACA \u2015 likely an easier vote under former President Barack Obama, who created the program and would not sign into law any bill to terminate the protections. Most of them also opposed previous efforts to provide reprieve to Dreamers, such as the Dream Act, a bill first introduced 16 years ago that would allow undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to gain legal status and eventual citizenship.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have multiple options if they want to sign on to current legislation to protect Dreamers. There is a 2017 iteration of the Dream Act in both chambers; the House bill has two Republican sponsors and the Senate bill has three Republican sponsors.</span></p>, <p>Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Tuesday that he plans to re-double his efforts on the Dream Act, criticizing Trump\u2019s announcement as \u201cthe wrong approach to immigration policy.\u201d</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">.<a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS">@POTUS</a>'s decision on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DACA?src=hash">#DACA</a> is wrong approach at a time when both sides need to compromise on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/immigration?src=hash">#immigration</a> reform <a href="https://t.co/kPBCUhJ2m4">https://t.co/kPBCUhJ2m4</a> <a href="https://t.co/5stY5spxOC">pic.twitter.com/5stY5spxOC</a></p>, <p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday called on Ryan to \u201cbring the Dream Act to the floor for a vote without delay.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP members have also created what they are calling a more conservative version of the Dream Act. It would provide a path to citizenship to Dreamers with some restrictions, such as eligibility for those who entered the country before they were 16 years old, versus the current cutoff of 18. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the House, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) introduced the Recognizing America\u2019s Children, or RAC, Act with support from 18 fellow Republicans. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said Tuesday that he is planning a similar bill in the Senate.</span></p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">My legislation will provide a fair and rigorous path for undocumented children to earn legal status. (6/9)</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans may try to tie legislation to help Dreamers to other measures, such as funding for Trump\u2019s border wall and increasing other deportation efforts. While Democrats have supported measures coupling legal status for undocumented immigrants and enforcement in the past, they </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-daca-dreamers_us_599c6eade4b06a788a2c3b72"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have said they would not allow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dreamers to be used as a bargaining chip.</span></p>, <p>On Tuesday, Sanders would not say whether Trump wants funding for the wall included in a bill addressing DACA recipients. She also would not say whether he would sign a \u201cstandalone\u201d bill, without any other conditions.</p>, <p>Yet she reiterated that Congress should pursue \u201ccomprehensive\u201d legislation that is not \u201ca one-piece fix\u201d \u2014 again providing few details on what that would entail, placing the ball squarely in Congress\u2019 court.</p>, <p><em>This article was updated with comments from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</em></p>]

They grew up in this country. They attended our local schools and count millions of American citizens as friends. They obey our laws, pay taxes here and have registered voluntarily with the federal government for DACA relief. They are loyal to this country and contribute their time and money to local churches, schools and community groups. The Dreamers are part of our nation\u2019s fabric. They belong here.</p>, <p>This is why we will work as needed with other companies and the broader business community to vigorously defend the legal rights of all Dreamers. For the 39 Dreamers that we know of who are our employees, our commitment is clear. If Congress fails to act, our company will exercise its legal rights properly to help protect our employees. If the government seeks to deport any one of them, we will provide and pay for their legal counsel. We will also file an amicus brief and explore whether we can directly intervene in any such case. In short, if Dreamers who are our employees are in court, we will be by their side.</p>, <p>Cook also noted the number of Dreamers who work at Apple and offered his support:</p>, <p dir="ltr" lang="en">250 of my Apple coworkers are <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dreamers?src=hash">#Dreamers</a>.

More than 97 percent are in school or in the workforce, 5 percent started their own business, 65 percent have purchased a vehicle, and 16 percent have purchased their first home.

Tests showed the baby-to-be \u2015 a boy \u2015 had Down syndrome, as well as a severe congenital heart defect and tumors. Sue was 38 at the time and she and her husband felt they could not bring a child into the world knowing the overwhelming challenges he would face.</p>, <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t think of leaving him alone in the world with Down syndrome and a huge heart defect \u2015 knowing he may not even get a heart replacement \u2015 and tumors,\u201d she told HuffPost.</p>, <p>Although the ultrasound tech who first discovered the fetal abnormalities told her it was too late to get an abortion, a genetic counselor Sue met with in the following days said she would make some calls. If the couple could come up with money quickly \u2015 somewhere in the ballpark of $10,000 \u2015 she might be able to get them in to see one of the few remaining providers in the country who performs later abortions, Dr. LeRoy Carhart. They did, and Sue drove two hours from Virginia to Maryland where she stayed in a hotel while the four-day procedure was completed.</p>, <p>That was three years ago. Last week, news quietly emerged that the clinic where Carhart has been a provider since 2010 \u2015 Germantown Reproductive Health Service in Maryland \u2015\xa0<a href="http://abortionpages.com/" target="_blank">has permanently closed</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/maryland-provider-of-late-term-abortions-under-contract-to-be-purchased-by-antiabortion-group/2017/08/25/78f91b94-89ac-11e7-a50f-e0d4e6ec070a_story.html?utm_term=.6f5ca041b33f" target="_blank">The Washington Post was the first to report</a>\xa0that the Germantown clinic is under contract to be purchased by the anti-abortion group the Maryland Coalition for Life, leaving women like Sue with even fewer options. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/maryland-provider-of-late-term-abortions-under-contract-to-be-purchased-by-antiabortion-group/2017/08/25/78f91b94-89ac-11e7-a50f-e0d4e6ec070a_story.html?utm_term=.ef84e5d22207" target="_blank">The Post reports</a> that the group raised funds to make an offer to buy out the current owners of the property who also ran a second clinic that did not offer later abortions.</p>, <p>\u201cThe Germantown clinic is one of only three in the country that provides abortions later in pregnancy,\u201d Dr. Carolyn Sufrin, an OB-GYN and member of Physicians for Reproductive Health, the advocacy group, told HuffPost.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThe women who need these services often have lethal fetal abnormalities or other extenuating life circumstances and did not learn about the pregnancies until late,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will mean that women who are in need of abortions later in pregnancy will have even fewer options, and will likely be unable to travel the distance to get to them.\u201d</p>, <p>Most states in this country prohibit abortions in the later stages of a pregnancy, though what \u201clater\u201d means varies.\xa0<a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-later-abortions" target="_blank">Seventeen states</a> currently prohibit most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, for example. Just this week, a federal judge <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-texas-law-banning-de-abortions_us_59a99da0e4b0b5e530fe7d0b">temporarily blocked</a> a Texas law that would restrict the most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions, another legislative tack used to limit later abortions.</p>, <p>Estimates suggest, however, that only about <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/later-abortion" target="_blank">9 percent</a> of women who get abortions in the United States do so after the first trimester, and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/later-abortion" target="_blank">just 1 percent</a> of abortions are performed at or after 21 weeks.\xa0</p>, <p>As one of the few remaining providers to perform later abortions, has been the subject to threats and violence. He has long bee open about the work he does, and was featured in the 2013 documentary \u201cAfter Tiller,\u201d about the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/31/george-tiller-abortion-do_n_209540.html">murder of abortion provider</a> George Tiller in 2009.\xa0</p>, <p>Carhart has reportedly vowed to open a new clinic in Maryland in order to continue to provide later abortion services, as well as to train other physicians.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cFor the last few years, Dr. Carhart has shared his vision with allies to create his own facility in Maryland to address the dearth of training available to medical professionals in later abortion care,\u201d Diana Philip, Executive Director of NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland, the reproductive rights advocacy group, <a href="http://www.prochoicemd.org/media/press/20170825.shtml" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>. She said that the clinic\u2019s closure had not come as a surprise to Maryland-based abortion providers, and that it had been known for some time that the clinic\u2019s owner was considering closing it.</p>, <p>But former patients like Sue, the news is sad. Though she said went into \u201csurvival mode\u201d during the abortion procedure, trying to stay as calm and detached as possible so she did not break down, she says the care she received was warm and supportive. Carhart, she believes, did his best to make the worst time in her life bearable.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cPlease tell me he is going to reopen somewhere else,\u201d Sue wrote in an e-mail to HuffPost after she learned the clinic had closed. \u201cThis is awful.\u201d</p>, <p><em><strong>* Name has been changed to protect privacy.\xa0</strong></em></p>]

She lived here before it was even a state. She remembers when most Alaskans were Democrats. She remembers when the oil industry came in \u2015 and with it, lots of money \u2015 and turned the Republican Party, her party, into \u201creally crazy right-wing nuts.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if there\u2019s been one constant, it\u2019s that people here pride themselves on being fiercely independent. And for Knutson, who lives on a homestead near the tiny town of Soldotna, there\u2019s one Alaskan in particular who\u2019s been embodying that spirit lately: Lisa Murkowski.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cOut of 100 members in the Senate, she\u2019s the only one that\u2019s really wearing the balls right now,\u201d said Knutson, in between bites of salmon at a 70-year-old\u2019s birthday party in Anchorage that HuffPost crashed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can put that in your story.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murkowski caught everyone\u2019s attention last month when she helped kill her party\u2019s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. She was\xa0</span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-repeal-flames-out-senate_us_597a6adbe4b02a4ebb744da0?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of three Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0\u2015 Susan Collins of Maine and John McCain of Arizona were the others \u2015 who voted with Democrats to sink a bill that would have gutted President\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/barack-obama" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a>\u2019s signature health care law.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the buzz about that vote centered on McCain, who returned to the Senate after a brain cancer diagnosis to cast a dramatic, last-minute vote against the bill. But it was Murkowski who stuck her neck out more than anyone.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For weeks, she and Collins resisted intense lobbying by their party to vote for various repeal bills. That was a particularly risky move for Murkowski, who, unlike Collins, represents a heavily Republican state.\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/890168183079960576"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lashed out at her on Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0over her opposition, saying she\u2019d \u201creally let the Republicans, and our country, down.\u201d\xa0</span>Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called her to warn that\xa0</span><a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2017/07/26/trump-administration-signals-that-murkowskis-health-care-vote-could-have-energy-repercussions-for-alaska/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy projects in her state were at risk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0if she didn\u2019t vote to repeal the law.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0For good measure, two separate House Republicans\xa0</span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-health-care-bill-female-senators_us_59763b9ee4b0a8a40e813278"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized</span></a>\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://time.com/4875702/buddy-carter-snatch-a-knot-in-their-ass-lisa-murkowski/">her</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0too.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, Murkowski didn\u2019t budge. She maintained that the repeal bills would be devastating for Alaskans. She was right; among other things, 25 percent of people in her state rely on Medicaid, a program the bills would have gutted. She also criticized the rushed, closed-door process GOP leaders used to bring the bills to the Senate floor. While Obamacare isn\u2019t perfect, she\u2019s argued, lawmakers need to take a more thorough approach to changing the law, one that includes public hearings and working with Democrats.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her votes\xa0</span><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-lisa-murkowski-20170729-story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">infuriated party officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0in Alaska. But she was hailed as a hero by constituents who had been urging her for weeks to vote \u201cno.\u201d People hugged her at the airport when she flew back to Anchorage. They held a rally for her that included a plane flying above with a massive \u201cThank You\u201d sign. They delivered roses to her office. In\xa0</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rdqOidjImY"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Q&amp;A with her summer interns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0that she posted on YouTube, she said her vote against repeal was the biggest difference she\u2019s made in her roughly 15 years as a senator.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe constant is remembering who you work for,\u201d Murkowski told the kids. \u201cI don\u2019t work for the party. I don\u2019t work for the president. I work for the people of Alaska. And sometimes that\u2019s hard.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThere are pressures that would allow you to forget that, that would put you in a place where it would just be easier if I just went along with what everybody else is doing,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut if it doesn\u2019t fit with who you represent, why are we here, if not to serve the people who sent us here?\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the Lisa Murkowski many Alaskans have long wanted to see.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since 2010, when she pulled off a stunning re-election victory, the mixed-up coalition of people who helped her win that year have been hoping she\u2019d get all mavericky. That was the year she lost the Republican primary to a tea party challenger. She responded by running as an independent, launching a write-in campaign featuring\xa0</span><a href="https://vimeo.com/21179499"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now-famous ads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0(see below) that carefully spelled out her name, M-U-R-K-O-W-S-K-I. Against the odds, and with no support from the Republican Party, she won, making her the first candidate to win in a write-in Senate campaign since South Carolina\u2019s Strom Thurmond in 1954.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn\u2019t get much more exciting than that, and the people she won over in 2010 \u2015 a smattering of Democrats, moderate Republicans and independents \u2015 hoped she\u2019d head back to D.C. emboldened to break from the GOP and go her own way. After all, Alaska may be a red state, but\xa0</span><a href="http://www.elections.alaska.gov/statistics/vi_vrs_stats_age_2015.12.03.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 50 percent of voters here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0are \u201cundeclared\u201d or \u201cnonpartisan.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWhen she ran as a write-in candidate, she really spoke to me,\u201d remembers one of those undeclared voters, 52-year-old Alyse Galvin of Anchorage. \u201cI thought, here\u2019s a woman in a very difficult state to be a strong woman, who seems to be willing to work in a bipartisan way. I bought in hook, line and sinker. I think most of Alaska did.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But back in Washington, there weren\u2019t obvious signs she\u2019d changed. She continued to vote mostly in lockstep with GOP leaders. It wasn\u2019t until this year that something shifted. In February, she was one of two Republicans who voted against confirming Trump\u2019s education secretary, Betsy DeVos. She\u2019s condemned Trump for berating the media. When the health care debate began in July, Murkowski voted no on a procedural step to even begin debate, and went on to oppose every version of Obamacare repeal that came up.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galvin, who is a co-founder of a local chapter of Great Alaska Schools, a statewide coalition that advocates for quality public education, led a petition and letter-writing campaign urging Murkowski to oppose DeVos\u2019 confirmation. She said she\u2019s been impressed with her senator, both for taking the time to truly understand education and health care policy, and then voting based on what\u2019s best for Alaskans, party politics be damned.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe idea that she did that \u2015 voted against repeal \u2015 at a time when she knew it really counted, makes me feel even more strongly that she\u2019s the kind of leader that I think the whole nation should be looking to right now,\u201d said Galvin, who was having lunch in a cozy Anchorage cafe with her two college-aged kids. \u201cShe gets the connection between her decisions and our lives, and I appreciate that wholeheartedly.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HuffPost spent several days in central Alaska in August, interviewing residents of small towns and the state\u2019s biggest city about how they\u2019re feeling about Murkowski these days. There was a theme: hard-line conservatives are miffed, and everyone else seems thrilled to see their senator stray from the party line.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think with her vote on health care, she finally recognized that she\u2019s in a unique position to actually be independent,\u201d said Vered Mares, 42, a Democrat in Anchorage. \u201cEven though she is a Republican, and I disagree with her almost unilaterally on her general policy decisions, on this issue she listened to the people who were calling into her office.\u201d</span></p>, <p>Murkowski has already distinguished herself from most of her GOP colleagues by being pro-choice, and her defense of Planned Parenthood funding during the health care debate didn\u2019t go unnoticed back home. She still votes mostly with GOP leaders, though.\xa0Some Democrats don\u2019t know what to make of her.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI mean, she has been really good on women\u2019s rights,\u201d said 35-year-old Shona Mull of Anchorage, who was chasing her toddler around a park in the town of Girdwood. \u201cWith Trump threatening to take away federal funds for energy and stuff, we were calling her and saying, \u2018Are you kidding me? You\u2019re Alaskan, you can\u2019t be bullied by this jerk.\u2019 So, I had a lot more respect for her there. I feel like there\u2019s more she could do, but ... yeah.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darren Lowry, a local beer distributor in the conservative town of Wasilla, was less impressed. He wants the state\u2019s senior senator to step down.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cBeing a Republican voting against Trump on the repeal bill, I could use words, but I\u2019m not going to,\u201d grumbled Lowry, 48, as he wrestled with a beer tap at a local AMVETS outpost. \u201cI\u2019d like to flour bomb her. You ever seen that before? When there are celebrities that people don\u2019t like very much, they get a sack of flour dumped on their heads?\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carl Seutter, a 48-year-old optician in Wasilla, said he didn\u2019t like that Murkowski voted for an Obamacare repeal bill in 2015, when it was a show vote, but opposed it this year when it could have become law.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cShe ran on saying one thing, and then turned around and did the opposite,\u201d said Seutter, fidgeting with a tube of kitchen caulk in an aisle at Lowe\u2019s.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Murkowski can take the criticism. She\u2019s been in politics since 1998, when she was elected to the state House of Representatives. In late 2002, her father, Sen. Frank Murkowski, appointed her to fill his seat after he was elected governor. Some Alaskans resented the fact that she got her Senate seat because of her last name. Bumper stickers surfaced around the state that read, \u201cLisa, who\u2019s your daddy?\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think that\u2019s how I learned that word \u2018nepotism,\u2019 through Lisa Murkowski,\u201d said Sean Galvin, 23, who is Alyse\u2019s son.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the senator was re-elected in her own right in 2004, and then came the 2010 campaign. That was a tough period. Her mentor, longtime Sen. Ted Stevens (R), died in a plane crash two weeks before the primary. Not only were they close, but she had lined up ads for the final weeks of her campaign that featured Stevens endorsing her. She pulled the ads and didn\u2019t have much to replace them with, which arguably contributed to her loss to tea party candidate Joe Miller.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her party completely dropped her after that. She was in Senate leadership at the time, and had to resign from her post. Her Republican colleagues were furious that she launched a write-in campaign against the GOP candidate, and\xa0</span><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/09/22/murkowski.committee.stripped/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they debated stripping her of her top seat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. She ultimately kept it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Halcro, a longtime friend and former Republican colleague of Murkowski\u2019s in the state legislature, remembers her being \u201cstunned\u201d by the fallout from her primary and learning quickly that she was going to have to go it alone if she wanted to keep her Senate seat.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you wake up one day like, wow, I don\u2019t have any friends,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cThey didn\u2019t care about Lisa. They didn\u2019t care about Joe Miller being an absolute nut bag. They just didn\u2019t care. He was a Republican; they wanted a Republican. She was an independent.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until 2010, Halcro said he\u2019d had some concerns that Murkowski wasn\u2019t voting like the moderate, pragmatic Republican he\u2019d known in the state legislature. But he thinks the write-in campaign jolted her back to her centrist roots, and that she\u2019s finally realizing the leeway she has to carve her own path.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think she\u2019s come full circle,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is rightly focused on the people that actually get her elected and those are the ones, Republicans and Democrats and independents, that want a U.S. senator that actually thinks about policy, not just about politics.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it seems wacky that a veteran Republican senator in a red state would count on people in all parties to get reelected, consider the mixed up politics of Alaska. It has an independent governor, who was once a Republican, paired with a Democratic lieutenant governor. Its junior senator, Dan Sullivan (R), defeated a Democratic incumbent for his seat, and he votes with Trump on everything. Alaska\u2019s lone House member, Don Young (R), has held his seat for more than 40 years and is best described as the curmudgeonly, mildly offensive grandfather who will always be the way he is. Sullivan and Young voted for Obamacare repeal; Murkowski did not. Yet, they all represent the same state. What?</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI think it\u2019s because we Alaskans, we appreciate characters here,\u201d suggested Alyse Galvin. \u201cIf they have a history of some sort, we tend to keep \u2019em along.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On some level, it makes sense. Alaska is remote. It\u2019s massive. Its roughly 750,000 residents are spread all over the place. Name recognition and legacy go a long way here. So does securing federal money for the state, which, among other things, has some of the worst health problems in the country. Sullivan is still just a first-term senator banking on the Trump vote. But Murkowski and Young have much deeper roots, and their famous names give them a certain freedom to do what they want.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cPeople do respect independent thinking. And they see [Murkowski] as picking up the legacy of Ted Stevens, who was dedicated to bringing federal benefits to Alaska,\u201d Stephen Haycox, an Alaska historian, said in an email. \u201cYoung is a forthright, unreconstructed states\u2019 rights conservative \u2026 He styles himself a last frontiersman. His office is full of the heads of dead animals.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If ever there was a time for Murkowski to let her independent streak shine, it\u2019s now. She\u2019s not up for re-election until 2022. She proved in 2010 she doesn\u2019t need her party to win over her constituents. She\u2019s excited people back home, eager to see what she\u2019ll do next. At a time when Congress is painfully polarized, she could be a bridge to bipartisanship (which is far better than\xa0</span><a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/article/bridge-nowhere-no-more-dot-choses-ferry-ketchikan/2015/10/23/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Bridge to Nowhere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). The question is whether she\u2019ll go that route.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HuffPost reached out several times to Murkowski\u2019s office for an interview, either by phone or in-person in Alaska. Her aides repeatedly she said was not available. (She was available for an interview about\xa0</span><a href="http://www.graydc.com/content/news/A-nutritional-trendsetter-Sen-Murkowski-growing-lettuce-on-Capitol-Hill-441623313.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing lettuce in her office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however.)</span></p>, <p>Knutson said she recently quit the Republican Party, after decades of being involved in politics, and became an independent. She said she\u2019s tired of\xa0\u201cthese Trump-like buffoons\u201d like Young and Sullivan who she said seem out of touch with regular Alaskans. She\u2019s thrilled with Murkowski, though, who she said has never lost sight of the constituents who put in her in office.\xa0She said she\u2019d even campaign for Murkowski if she ran for president.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe only have one voice of reason in Alaska,\u201d said Knutson. \u201cBecause Don and Dan aren\u2019t listening. But Lisa is. And when you call, you can still talk to her.\u201d</span></p>]

Sessions, who<strong>\xa0</strong>supports enforcing current law through increased deportations,<strong>\xa0</strong>has opposed the DACA program since its inception under President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a> in 2012. As a senator, he helped block legislative efforts to help so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d who came to the U.S. as children.\xa0</span></p>, <p>\u201cWe are people of compassion and we are people of law,\u201d Sessions said during a speech at the Department of Justice. \u201cBut there is nothing compassionate about the failure to enforce immigration laws. ...\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">The compassionate thing to do is to end the lawlessness, enforce our laws and, if Congress chooses to make changes to those laws, to do so through the process set forth by our founders in a way that advances the interest of the American people.\u201d\xa0</span></p>, <p>DACA protections, which last for two years and allow Dreamers to work legally, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/05/memorandum-rescission-daca" target="_blank">won\u2019t end immediately</a>. Current DACA recipients whose permits expire between now and March 5 can apply to renew them, but must submit their renewal applications by Oct. 5 or will be unable to do so. Individuals who do not currently have DACA protections cannot receive permits unless they applied to the program before Sept. 5.</p>, <p>Dreamers whose permits expire on March 6 or later will begin to lose their protections and work permits as soon as they expire, putting them at risk of deportation.</p>, <p>Trump said in a statement that he \u201cadvised the Department of Homeland Security that DACA recipients are not enforcement priorities unless they are criminals, are involved in criminal activity, or are members of a gang.\u201d</p>, <p>But losing DACA protections would nonetheless put Dreamers at risk of being sent away from the country they\u2019ve lived in since they were children.\xa0Although administration officials have said their focus is on deporting criminals, they have also made clear that no undocumented immigrant is safe from being detained or forced out of the country. That includes Dreamers, some of whom have already been locked up.\xa0</p>, <p>Department of Homeland Security officials said before the announcement that there are no plans to specifically target current DACA recipients or use their information for enforcement purposes, although they will continue to do so if needed for criminal or national security investigations.\xa0</p>, <p>The official Trump administration announcement comes on the Sept. 5 deadline set by 10 state attorneys general who <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dreamers-daca_us_59557545e4b02734df31197d">threatened legal action</a> if Trump did not announce a phaseout of DACA by that date. Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery III (R)\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republians-dreamers-daca_us_59acb953e4b0dfaafcf1255c">backed off that threat last week</a>, but the others continued to demand an end to the program. The threat was not a court order, so it was not a mandate for the Trump administration to end the program ahead of a legal challenge or ruling.</p>, <p>Trump misstated the facts of the threat in a statement after Sessions\u2019 announcement. The president claimed that\xa0\u201cofficials from 10 States are suing over the program,\u201d even though they had not taken legal action and only nine of the 10 states had maintained that threat.</p>, <p>Trump <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-to-end-daca-report-politico_us_59acaa61e4b0b5e530ff6e88?6mn">decided to end</a> DACA against the wishes of Democrats and some members of his own party, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-daca-dreamers_us_59a86e41e4b0dfaafceef55a">said Congress</a> should get the chance to pass a bill.</p>, <p>The president said on Tuesday afternoon that he hoped Congress would move forward to help Dreamers, although he said nothing about what he thinks they should do.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly,\u201d Trump said in the White House. \u201cAnd I can tell you, speaking to members of Congress, they want to be able to do something and do it right. ...\xa0I think it\u2019s going to work out very well and long-term, it\u2019s going to be the right solution.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of Trump\u2019s announcement, a number of Republicans <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republians-dreamers-daca_us_59acb953e4b0dfaafcf1255c">said they would be willing</a> to support protections for Dreamers that Democrats have attempted to get through Congress multiple times.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Republicans opposed those past measures, including the Dream Act, a bill first introduced in 2001 that would grant legal status to some undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. The bill has a small number of Republican supporters, but the White House </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dream-act_us_5970b9a4e4b062ea5f901576"><span style="font-weight: 400;">immediately shot it down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it was re-introduced in the Senate in July. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans are pushing what they say is a more conservative version of the Dream Act, called the Recognizing America\u2019s Children Act, or RAC Act, which would offer a path to citizenship to a smaller category of Dreamers.</span>\xa0</p>, <p>Sessions\u2019 speech only mentioned one piece of legislation specifically: the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-cotton-perdue-legal-immigration_us_5981eb6ae4b09d24e99482a8">RAISE Act</a>, which would slash legal immigration numbers and has nothing to do with Dreamers. His remarks more broadly made the case against offering Dreamers legal status, something he has opposed many times throughout his career.\xa0</p>, <p>Sessions said that DACA \u201cdenied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same illegal aliens to take those jobs\u201d \u2015 an argument that could also be applied to legislation that allows Dreamers to stay in the country and work legally. He claimed that a surge in unaccompanied minors at the southwest U.S. border was also due to DACA, although those children were ineligible for the program. Sessions also said that the U.S. \u201cmust set and enforce a limit on how many immigrants we admit each year.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cThis does not mean they are bad people or that our nation disrespects or demeans them in any way,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIt means we are properly enforcing our laws as Congress has passed them.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s statement similarly emphasized other changes to the immigration system. Like Sessions, he cited the RAISE Act and said his \u201cfirst and highest priority in advancing immigration reform must be to improve jobs, wages and security for American workers and their families.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, we will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion \u2013 but through the lawful Democratic process \u2013 while at the same time ensuring that any immigration reform we adopt provides enduring benefits for the American citizens we were elected to serve,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe must also have heart and compassion for unemployed, struggling, and forgotten Americans.\u201d</p>, <p><em>This story has been updated with Donald Trump\u2019s statements.</em></p>]

But he had a work permit and protection from immediate deportation as part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u2015 DACA \u2015 that then-President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/barack-obama" target="_blank">Barack Obama</a> established in 2012.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, he headed south from his home in Lufkin, Texas, with a borrowed boat, insisting he wanted to help rescue flood survivors. His father, a legal permanent resident, wept on the sandy banks of Cypress Creek on Sunday as his son\u2019s body was pulled from the water, the Chronicle reported. Jesus Guillen recounted to the paper\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how he asked his son not to go on the rescue mission with two friends, and that he thanked God for the time he had with his son. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His mother, Rita Ruiz de Guillen, was contacted by Chronicle at her home in Piedras Negras, Mexico. \u201cI\u2019m asking God to give me strength,\u201d she said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also told the paper that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials denied her entry at the border, despite her pleas for a temporary visa to come to Texas for her son\u2019s burial.</span></p>, <p>On Monday, however, the customs and border agency said it had no record of Guillen\u2019s mother applying for admission to the U.S. in 2017.</p>, <p><a href="https://twitter.com/CustomsBorder/status/904803260422344704" target="_blank">In a statement</a>, the agency said it has \u201coffered to work with the Mexican Consulate and non-governmental agencies\u201d to allow her entry \u201cin order to attend her son\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p>, <p>The agency also offered its condolences to Alonso Guillen\u2019s family.</p>, <p>The boat that he and his two friends were in capsized when it hit a bridge around midnight Wednesday, according to the Chronicle.

But the timing of his death spotlights the contributions he and other Dreamers have made to the U.S.</p>, <p>Trump reportedly will announce on Tuesday his decision to end the DACA program. His termination order won\u2019t be enforced for six months, according to the reports, which gives the White House or Congress time to craft an alternative to deporting the\xa0<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/daca-recipients-worry-future-trump-continues-review-program/story?id=49566992">nearly 800,000</a>\xa0Dreamers.

In a radio interview in Janesville, Wisconsin, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said \u201cthere needs to be a legislative solution\u201d addressing the status of Dreamers. He said he counseled Trump not to end DACA in part because \u201cthese are kids that know no other country.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sen.

Security Council was set to meet later on Monday to discuss new sanctions against the isolated regime. U.S. President Donald Trump had also asked to be briefed on all available military options, according to his defense chief.</p>, <p>Officials said activity around missile launch sites suggested North Korea planned more missile tests.</p>, <p>\u201cWe have continued to see signs of possibly more ballistic missile launches. We also forecast North Korea could fire an intercontinental ballistic missile,\u201d Jang Kyoung-soo, acting deputy minister of national defense policy, told a parliament hearing on Monday.</p>, <p>North Korea tested two ICBMs in July that could fly about 10,000 km (6,200 miles), putting many parts of the U.S. mainland within range and prompting a new round of tough international sanctions.</p>, <p>South Korea\u2019s air force and army conducted exercises involving long-range air-to-surface and ballistic missiles on Monday following the North\u2019s nuclear test on Sunday, its joint chiefs of staff said in a statement.</p>, <p>In addition to the drill, South Korea will cooperate with the United States and seek to deploy \u201cstrategic assets like aircraft carriers and strategic bombers\u201d, Jang said.</p>, <p>South Korea\u2019s defense ministry also said it would deploy the four remaining launchers of a new U.S. missile defense system after the completion of an environmental assessment by the government.</p>, <p>The rollout of the controversial Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system at a site south of the South Korean capital, Seoul, is vehemently opposed by neighboring China and Russia, had been delayed since June.</p>, <p>North Korea said it tested an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile on Sunday, prompting a warning of a \u201cmassive\u201d military response from the United States if it or its allies were threatened.</p>, <p>\u201cWe are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said after meeting Trump and his national security team.</p>, <p>\u201cBut as I said, we have many options to do so.\u201d</p>, <p>Trump has previously vowed to stop North Korea developing nuclear weapons and said he would unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d if it threatened U.S. territory</p>, <p>Despite the tough talk, the immediate focus of the international response was expected to be on tougher economic sanctions.</p>, <p>Diplomats have said the U.N. Security Council could now consider banning North Korean textile exports and its national airline, stop supplies of oil to the government and military, prevent NorthKoreans from working abroad and add top officials to a blacklist to subject them to an asset freeze and travel ban.</p>, <p>Asked about Trump\u2019s threat to punish countries that trade with North Korea, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China has dedicated itself to resolving the North Korean issue via talks, and China\u2019s efforts had been recognized.</p>, <p>\u201cWhat we absolutely cannot accept is that on the one hand (we are) making arduous efforts to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, and on the other hand (our) interests are being sanctioned or harmed. This is both not objective and not fair,\u201d he told a regular briefing.</p>, <p>On possible new U.N. sanctions, and whether China would support cutting off oil, Geng said it would depend on the outcome of Security Council discussions.</p>, <p>Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency said in an editorial North Korea was \u201cplaying a dangerous game of brinkmanship\u201d and it should wake up to the fact that such a tactic \u201ccan never bring security it pursues\u201d.</p>, <p>While South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed on Monday to work with the United States to pursue stronger sanctions, Russia voiced scepticism.</p>, <p>Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said sanctions on North Korea had reached the limit of their impact. Any more would be aimed at breaking its economy, so a decision to impose further constraints would become dramatically harder, he told a BRICS summit in China.</p>, <p>South Korea says the aim of stronger sanctions is to draw North Korea into dialogue. But, in a series of tweets on Sunday, Trump also appeared to rebuke South Korea for that approach.</p>, <p>\u201cSouth Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!\u201d Trump said on Twitter.</p>, <p>Still, Trump\u2019s response was more orderly and less haphazard than he had offered to other hostile actions by North Korea.</p>, <p>His handling of its latest nuclear test reflected a more traditional approach to crisis management, which U.S. officials said illustrated the influence of Mattis and new White House chief of staff, retired Marine Corps General John Kelly.</p>, <p>Japanese and South Korean stock markets both closed down about 1 percent on Monday, while safe haven assets including gold and sovereign bonds ticked higher, but trade was cautious. [MKTS/GLOB]</p>, <p>\u201cAssuming the worst on the Korean peninsula has not proven to be a winning trading strategy this year,\u201d said Sean Callow, a senior foreign exchange strategist at Westpac Bank.</p>, <p>\u201cInvestors seem reluctant to price in anything more severe than trade sanctions, and the absence of another \u2018fire and fury\u2019 Trump tweet has helped encourage markets to respond warily.\u201d</p>, <p>South Korea\u2019s finance minister vowed to support financial markets if instability showed signs of spreading to the real economy.</p>, <p>Sunday\u2019s test had registered with international seismic agencies as a man-made earthquake near a test site. Japanese and South Korean officials said the tremor was about 10 times more powerful than the one picked up after North Korea\u2019s previous nuclear test a year ago.</p>, <p>China\u2019s National Nuclear Safety Administration said data from radiation monitoring stations near the North Korean border showed no impact on \u201cChina\u2019s environment or populace\u201d.</p>, <p>Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that, while North Korea was not a puppet state of China, Beijing needed to do more to pressure its neighbor.</p>, <p>\u201cThe Chinese are frustrated and dismayed by North Korea\u2019s conduct, but China has the greatest leverage, and with the greatest leverage comes the greatest responsibility,\u201d he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Monday.</p>, <p><em>(Additional reporting by Shin-hyung Lee, Hyunjoo Jin, Cynthia Kim in SEOUL, Steve Holland and John Walcott in WASHINGTON, John Ruwitch in SHANGHAI, Wayne Cole and Swati Pandey in SYDNEY; Writing by Lincoln Feast; Editing by Paul Tait, Robert Birsel)</em></p>]

But Will They?</h1>|[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON \u2015 Republican lawmakers who have said they sympathize with young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children will now get the chance to prove it. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-to-end-daca-report-politico_us_59acaa61e4b0b5e530ff6e88?6mn">has decided to terminate</a> the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, with a six-month delay on enforcement, </span><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/03/trump-dreamers-immigration-daca-immigrants-242301"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2017-09-03/trump-to-scrap-protection-for-dreamers-give-congress-six-months-to-fix"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported on Sunday evening. An official announcement is expected on Tuesday with further details. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ending the program would mean nearly 800,000 so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d who have been in the U.S. since they were children would eventually lose two-year work permits and be at risk for deportation. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump\u2019s decision puts Republicans in a bind. Many of them have said they think something should be done to help Dreamers, and some pro-immigration-reform Republicans have joined Democrats to push for legislation.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most Republicans \u2015 including party leaders in the House and Senate \u2015 have repeatedly voted to block legislation that would allow young undocumented immigrants to stay in the country. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) hasn\u2019t allowed votes on bills that would allow legal status for Dreamers, and his predecessor, former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), let a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 die in the House.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan and other GOP members now say they\u2019re ready for legislation. But the question will be whether they\u2019re willing to break from the past and work with Democrats to make it happen. Doing so could invite primary challenges from the right.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-daca-dreamers_us_59a86e41e4b0dfaafceef55a">said on Friday</a> that he had urged Trump not to end DACA because he believed Congress should pass a bill to protect Dreamers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThere are people in limbo,\u201d Ryan said on the radio station WCLO in Janesville, Wisconsin. \u201cThese are kids that know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don\u2019t know another home, and so I really do believe there needs to be a legislative solution, that\u2019s one that we\u2019re working on.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others similarly urged Trump not to end the program, which he is expected to announce Tuesday \u2015 the deadline set for him by 10 state attorneys general who threatened legal action if he did not terminate DACA by that date.</span></p>, <p>Speaking about Dreamers, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)\xa0<a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-tom-cotton-top-senate-immigration-hawk-supports-legalization-in-daca-deal/article/2633325?platform=hootsuite" target="_blank">told The Washington Examiner</a>\xa0<span tabindex="0">Sunday</span>\xa0evening \u201cwe ought to take care of them,\u201d and it wasn\u2019t their fault they had come to the country illegally.</p>, <p>\u201cIn any legislative fix, I would like to see them receive a green card,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ought to recognize that giving them legal status has two problems. First, it creates a whole new class of people who will then be eligible for a green card and citizenship \u2015 namely, the extended family members of those who will receive legal status who can, through chain migration, get legal status themselves.\u201d</p>, <p>Cotton added such a program would also encourage more illegal immigration, a problem he said could be fixed by passing an immigration bill he and Trump both back that would make it more difficult to come<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-cotton-perdue-legal-immigration_us_5981eb6ae4b09d24e99482a8" target="_blank">\xa0to the U.S. legally</a>. That bill would face heavy opposition from Democrats and some Republicans because it would slash legal immigration numbers.\xa0He also called for expanding E-Verify, a government system employers can use to verify the identity of job applicants.</p>, <p>On Friday, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery (R), announced he would not take part in the legal challenge to DACA as he\u2019d promised and\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tennessee-daca-herbert-slatery_us_59a9c26de4b0b5e530feba7e">called for legislation</a> on Dreamers. Slatery encouraged senators to support the Dream Act, a bill that would provide a path to legal status for undocumented young people who came to the country as children, or legislation like it.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dream Act currently has bipartisan sponsors in both the House and Senate, but a majority of Republicans have opposed past efforts to get it through Congress since it was first introduced in 2001.</span></p>, <p>Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) also urged Trump not to end DACA.</p>, <p>\u201cIt is right for there to be consequences for those who intentionally entered this country illegally,\u201d\xa0<a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/04/republican-senator-urges-trump-to-keep-dreamers-program/" target="_blank">he said in a statement</a>.\xa0\xa0\u201cHowever, we as Americans do not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents.\u201d</p>, <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)\xa0<a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/904755988204544002/photo/1" target="_blank">said in a Monday statement</a>\xa0he supported seeking a legislative solution to the plight of Dreamers, should Trump give Congress a six-month window to act.</p>, <p>\u201cI have always believed DACA was presidential overreach. However, I equally understand the plight of Dream Act kids who \u2015 for all practical purposes \u2015 know no country other than America,\u201d said Graham.\xa0</p>, <p>Some Republicans are also pushing for the Recognizing America\u2019s Children Act, or RAC Act, which they\u2019re calling a conservative answer to the Dream Act. It similarly would allow Dreamers to receive legal status and eventually become eligible for citizenship, but would have narrower eligibility requirements. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) plans to introduce the bill in the Senate in the coming weeks; Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), a moderate member, has already introduced it in the House. It also has backing outside Congress:\xa0Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) <a href="https://twitter.com/FLGovScott/status/903740687472091137" target="_blank">came out in support</a> of the bill last week.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are GOP members who would likely support legislation for Dreamers as standalone bills, without other conditions. But most have said they would only vote on bills that help undocumented immigrants if Congress first addresses border security or enforcement measures \u2015 if they would vote for them at all. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have previously supported bills coupling border security and enforcement with legal status for undocumented immigrants. But they\u2019d likely only go so far \u2015 Democratic leaders have dismissed an idea floated by the White House to protect Dreamers in exchange for slashing legal immigration numbers, funding Trump\u2019s border wall and increasing other deportation efforts. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have argued Dreamers shouldn\u2019t be used as a bargaining chip, and young undocumented immigrant activists agree. That means Democrats and advocates may eventually be forced into a bind of their own over whether to sell out other immigrants to protect Dreamers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standalone bills that support Dreamers could likely get enough support to pass, but that would probably require a large number of Democratic votes and a smaller proportion of Republicans. Ryan and McConnell would have to bring those bills for a vote for it to happen. Whether they want to remains to be seen. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of the Republican opposition to DACA, it has saved them for five years from having to actually do anything to support the Dreamers they say should be helped. That might be why some of them didn\u2019t want Trump to end it.</span></p>, <p><em>This story has been updated to include a comment from Sen. Lindsey Graham.</em></p>, <p><em><strong>CORRECTION:\xa0</strong>A previous version of this story stated that House Speaker Paul Ryan did not allow a House vote on an immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013.

But the decision wouldn\u2019t take effect for six months, raising the prospect that Trump could change his mind or Congress could work on a legislative solution \u2015 and prolonging uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of people protected by the program.</p>, <p>On Sunday, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/03/trump-dreamers-immigration-daca-immigrants-242301" target="_blank">Politico</a>\xa0and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2017-09-03/trump-to-scrap-protection-for-dreamers-give-congress-six-months-to-fix" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reported that Trump plans to eventually terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants work permits and protections for so-called Dreamers, or undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children.</p>, <p>There will be a six-month delay to any enforcement of the president\u2019s decision, unnamed sources told\xa0<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/03/trump-dreamers-immigration-daca-immigrants-242301" target="_blank">Politico</a>\xa0and\xa0<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2017-09-03/trump-to-scrap-protection-for-dreamers-give-congress-six-months-to-fix" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, which would give Trump ample time to reverse his decision or decline to follow through on it. Otherwise, Congress would have to pass legislation during that gap if they want to keep protections for DACA recipients in place. Dreamers might not know for months whether or how their lives could be upended.\xa0</p>, <p>The White House is expected to officially announce Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday.</p>, <p>The decision would run against the recommendation of some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-daca-dreamers_us_59a86e41e4b0dfaafceef55a?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009">said Friday that Trump should</a>\xa0keep DACA in place while Congress works on a legislative solution.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program, often referred to as DACA, allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. before they turned 16 to apply for two-year work authorization and reprieve from deportation. Since President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012, nearly 800,000 people have been granted those protections, which meant they could obtain driver\u2019s licenses, work legally and live without the imminent threat of being returned to countries they hadn\u2019t seen since childhood.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump\u2019s decision comes ahead of an informal Sept. 5 deadline set by state attorneys general who\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dreamers-daca_us_59557545e4b02734df31197d">threatened legal action</a>\xa0if the president did not suspend DACA by that time.</span></p>, <p>But supporters of DACA, including members of Congress and immigrant rights groups, said Trump could have fought for the program in court \u2015 or even waited to see if the states actually followed through on a legal challenge. They\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca_us_599f21f3e4b05710aa5ad224" target="_blank">made a last-ditch push</a>\xa0to persuade him to maintain DACA. Instead, the president\u2019s decision could put those hundreds of thousands of Dreamers in limbo.</p>, <p>Trump said repeatedly during his presidential campaign that he would end DACA \u2015 which he argued was unconstitutional \u2015 immediately upon becoming president. But he also spoke often about Dreamers in a vague but positive way, hinting that he favored action to support them. Last December, Trump said he would \u201c<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-daca-dreamers_us_58481963e4b0d0df18372021" target="_blank">work something out</a>\u201d for Dreamers. In February, he said he would \u201c<a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-were-going-to-show-great-heart-daca" target="_blank">show great heart</a>\u2033 toward them. In April, he said Dreamers should \u201c<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/21/trump-dreamers-rest-easy-immigration-237463" target="_blank">rest easy</a>\u201d because his focus was deporting criminals.\xa0</p>, <p>White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said\xa0<span tabindex="0">on Thursday</span>\xa0ahead of the announcement that Trump \u201cabsolutely\u201d stood by his commitment to treat Dreamers with heart.</p>, <p>The president has kept DACA going for months in spite of his previous claims that it was illegal. From January through March, during most of which he was president, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved nearly 125,000 people for DACA, most of them for renewal.</p>, <p>DACA recipients have not been entirely safe, however, under the Trump administration. Immigrant rights advocates said there has been an uptick in the detention of Dreamers since the president took over and began an expansion of deportation efforts.</p>, <p>Without DACA,\xa0all Dreamers would be at risk of deportation. Trump officials have said no individuals are exempt from removal, and have sought to deport people who merely cross their paths even if they haven\u2019t otherwise committed a crime. Trump wants to deport more undocumented immigrants, and more DACA recipients will likely be among them.</p>, <p>There could also be major economic implications. If DACA recipients are unable to renew their work permits, nearly 700,000 people who are currently employed would exit the workforce. An average of 1,400 people would lose work authorization each business day and more than 6,000 could be fired in the first week alone, according to a\xa0<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release/2017/08/28/437944/release-daca-recipients-economic-educational-gains-continue-grow-according-largest-study-date/" target="_blank">recent report</a>\xa0by FWD.us and the Center for American Progress, both supporters of the program.</p>, <p>Deporting Dreamers is not a popular move \u2015 even among Republicans and Trump supporters,\xa0<a href="https://morningconsult.com/2017/06/16/poll-trumps-decision-dreamers-popular-one-even-among-base/" target="_blank">according to polling</a>. Nearly two-thirds of all Americans support DACA,\xa0according to a\xa0<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/poll-most-oppose-trump-s-pardon-ex-sheriff-arpaio-booting-n797526" target="_blank">NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll</a>.\xa0That means there is a chance Congress will step in and protect Dreamers, although it\u2019s not clear the White House would buy in without major concessions from Democrats on a border wall, immigration enforcement and cuts to legal immigration. Such a deal was reportedly being pushed by top White House officials, but Democrats\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-daca-dreamers_us_599c6eade4b06a788a2c3b72" target="_blank">quickly shot it down</a>\xa0at the time, saying Dreamers should not be used as bargaining chips.</p>, <p>The White House has not supported other bipartisan efforts to help Dreamers that don\u2019t have additional items attached, such as the stopgap Bridge Act, which would temporarily extend protections, or the Dream Act, which would put them on a path to legal status and potential citizenship.</p>, <p>Congressional Republicans have repeatedly blocked efforts to grant legal protections to Dreamers, but will be under increased pressure to do so after Trump\u2019s announcement. Ahead of the decision, some Republican lawmakers said they planned to work on more legislation that focuses on Dreamers.\xa0</p>, <p>Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) intends to introduce what some backers are touting as a conservative version of the Dream Act, called the Recognizing America\u2019s Children, or RAC Act, which was already introduced in the House and would grant legal status to a slightly narrower category of young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\xa0</p>, <p>Ryan, the House speaker, said\xa0<span tabindex="0">Friday</span>\xa0he also wants to pass a bill on Dreamers.\xa0\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThere are people in limbo,\u201d Ryan said on WCLO radio in Janesville, Wisconsin. \u201cThese are kids that know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don\u2019t know another home, and so I really do believe there needs to be a legislative solution, that\u2019s one that we\u2019re working on.\u201d</p>]

And you can see the amount of the supplies that have been donated.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>It was hard to witness the shape some of the animals were in as they arrived. Many were emaciated, severely dehydrated and had skin conditions, after being stranded in dirty, toxic water.</p>, <p>\u201cTheir skin was literally falling off,\u201d Maggie Olthaus, a veterinary technician at Bella Vista Equine in Blacklick, Ohio, said of some of the horses she treated.</p>, <p>Like Moore, Olthaus found it hard to explain how she ended up in Ford Park.</p>, <p>\u201cWe came to work on Wednesday with a full schedule of our normal day planned out. Around 7 a.m. we all decided we needed to come and help out. We put the post out on Facebook on our page asking for donations so that we could start packing things and getting ready to leave, and the public outreach we received \u2026 it was so incredible.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cWe started out with two trailers filled with hay, $3,500 of donated medical supplies and equipment donated by MWI Veterinary Supply, a company we do business with,\u201d Olthaus said.</p>, <p>In the days since, she said, her group has raised more than $20,000. \u201cWe have multiple semis headed down here hauling hundreds of bales of hay and tons of grain,\u201d along with other supplies, she said. \u201cOvernight, things have gotten very organized.\u201d</p>, <p>IV bags were still hanging from many of the remaining horses on Sunday afternoon. The ones that need more care are being stabilized, so they can be transferred to Texas A&amp;M University and another large animal clinic for further treatment.</p>, <p>\u201cBetween all the vets that showed up, all the volunteers, and all the supplies, we basically saved 150, 160 horses,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe only lost four horses, which is pretty much miraculous considering the shape they were coming in.\u201d</p>, <p>Harley, a 7-year-old quarterhorse, is among those heading to Texas A&amp;M, where she will be treated for a fever and possibly pneumonia.</p>, <p>\u201cI got her at 8 months. She is my baby,\u201d said Jamie Sander, a 33-year-old woman who was born in Austin and now lives in Colorado.</p>, <p>Haley was one of three horses that Jamie and her sister, Cristina Coots, were planning to take to Colorado.</p>, <p>Floodwater at the facility where the horses were being held was knee-deep in one area and muddy everywhere else.</p>, <p>\u201cThey were good until the wind got really bad, and then they were anxious with each other, just kicking and biting,\u201d Coots said. \u201cOur 2-year-old stud has bites all over him. We know it\u2019s from her and the other horse.\u201d</p>, <p>Coots, a 43-year-old mother of five, said the hurricane has given her a new perspective, despite all she has seen at Ford Park and elsewhere in Texas.</p>, <p>\u201cI feel fortunate because this is the most we lost. We didn\u2019t lose everything, and we pray for the people who did. Because I\u2019ve seen a lot of the devastation and it\u2019s bad, and it\u2019s hard to explain to my kids.\u201d</p>]

The money would replenish FEMA coffers so that it can continue to respond to Harvey and meet the immediate needs of other crises that may arise. The other $450 million would go to the Small Business Administration\u2019s disaster loan program, designed to help individuals and small businesses begin rebuilding their homes.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the package almost certainly won\u2019t be the last funding legislation responding to the damage caused by Harvey in southeastern Texas, it could complicate other urgent matters facing Congress. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government funding runs until Sept. 30, close to the time that the government\u2019s borrowing authority expires. A leading option for congressional leaders has to address both issues in a bill to extend funding until mid-December through a so-called continuing resolution and raise the debt ceiling for some yet-to-be-determined period.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although such legislation may not naturally be too popular among Republicans \u2015 especially if it doesn\u2019t fund President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>\u2019s border wall and </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">does</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fund certain Obamacare payments to win over Democrats \u2015 GOP leaders had believed the inclusion of Harvey aid could be enough to get many of their party members to support the bill.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second round of disaster relief \u2015 tightly focused to the specific needs of southeastern Texas \u2015 still could be part of a continuing resolution/debt ceiling measure. But there\u2019s also the chance that acting this week of partial Harvey-related aid will remove some of the motivation for conservatives to grudgingly back a spending/debt ceiling deal.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conservatives could more reasonably argue that they showed their support for Harvey aid at the beginning of the month, but that they do not back raising the debt ceiling without structural spending reforms or funding the government if Trump doesn\u2019t get money to build his wall.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, Trump </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-wall-shutdown_us_599dada8e4b0a296083babf0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told a rally in Phoenix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he was getting funding for that wall even \u201cif we have to close down our government.\u201d That sort of condition could be a real problem for GOP leaders, as Democrats seem to have no intention of giving in to Trump\u2019s demands and are reasonably confident that the public would blame Republicans for a shutdown. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, GOP leaders may still intend to attach a larger Harvey aid package in the final version of a continuing resolution/debt ceiling bill. They can still argue that Harvey aid is a key win for Congress, and that voting \u2018no\u2019 would come with the political backlash of ignoring a devastated community.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But letting lawmakers vote on the initial Harvey aid package first, tempering any immediate <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-harvey-texas-republicans-sandy-hypocrisy_us_59a46fcce4b041393a1fc43a" target="_blank">criticism that they\u2019re heartless</a>, could prove to be a political misstep, even as the GOP leaders try to do the right thing.</span></p>]

But Will They?</h1>|[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON \u2015 Republican lawmakers who have said they sympathize with young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children will now get the chance to prove it. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-to-end-daca-report-politico_us_59acaa61e4b0b5e530ff6e88?6mn">has decided to terminate</a> the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, with a six-month delay on enforcement, </span><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/03/trump-dreamers-immigration-daca-immigrants-242301"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politico</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2017-09-03/trump-to-scrap-protection-for-dreamers-give-congress-six-months-to-fix"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported on Sunday evening. An official announcement is expected on Tuesday with further details. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ending the program would mean nearly 800,000 so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d who have been in the U.S. since they were children would eventually lose two-year work permits and be at risk for deportation. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump\u2019s decision puts Republicans in a bind. Many of them have said they think something should be done to help Dreamers, and some pro-immigration-reform Republicans have joined Democrats to push for legislation.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most Republicans \u2015 including party leaders in the House and Senate \u2015 have repeatedly voted to block legislation that would allow young undocumented immigrants to stay in the country. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) hasn\u2019t allowed votes on bills that would allow legal status for Dreamers, and his predecessor, former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), let a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 die in the House.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan and other GOP members now say they\u2019re ready for legislation. But the question will be whether they\u2019re willing to break from the past and work with Democrats to make it happen. Doing so could invite primary challenges from the right.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-daca-dreamers_us_59a86e41e4b0dfaafceef55a">said on Friday</a> that he had urged Trump not to end DACA because he believed Congress should pass a bill to protect Dreamers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThere are people in limbo,\u201d Ryan said on the radio station WCLO in Janesville, Wisconsin. \u201cThese are kids that know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don\u2019t know another home, and so I really do believe there needs to be a legislative solution, that\u2019s one that we\u2019re working on.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others similarly urged Trump not to end the program, which he is expected to announce Tuesday \u2015 the deadline set for him by 10 state attorneys general who threatened legal action if he did not terminate DACA by that date.</span></p>, <p>Speaking about Dreamers, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)\xa0<a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-tom-cotton-top-senate-immigration-hawk-supports-legalization-in-daca-deal/article/2633325?platform=hootsuite" target="_blank">told The Washington Examiner</a>\xa0<span tabindex="0">Sunday</span>\xa0evening \u201cwe ought to take care of them,\u201d and it wasn\u2019t their fault they had come to the country illegally.</p>, <p>\u201cIn any legislative fix, I would like to see them receive a green card,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ought to recognize that giving them legal status has two problems. First, it creates a whole new class of people who will then be eligible for a green card and citizenship \u2015 namely, the extended family members of those who will receive legal status who can, through chain migration, get legal status themselves.\u201d</p>, <p>Cotton added such a program would also encourage more illegal immigration, a problem he said could be fixed by passing an immigration bill he and Trump both back that would make it more difficult to come<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-cotton-perdue-legal-immigration_us_5981eb6ae4b09d24e99482a8" target="_blank">\xa0to the U.S. legally</a>. That bill would face heavy opposition from Democrats and some Republicans because it would slash legal immigration numbers.\xa0He also called for expanding E-Verify, a government system employers can use to verify the identity of job applicants.</p>, <p>On Friday, Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery (R), announced he would not take part in the legal challenge to DACA as he\u2019d promised and\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tennessee-daca-herbert-slatery_us_59a9c26de4b0b5e530feba7e">called for legislation</a> on Dreamers. Slatery encouraged senators to support the Dream Act, a bill that would provide a path to legal status for undocumented young people who came to the country as children, or legislation like it.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dream Act currently has bipartisan sponsors in both the House and Senate, but a majority of Republicans have opposed past efforts to get it through Congress since it was first introduced in 2001.</span></p>, <p>Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) also urged Trump not to end DACA.</p>, <p>\u201cIt is right for there to be consequences for those who intentionally entered this country illegally,\u201d\xa0<a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/04/republican-senator-urges-trump-to-keep-dreamers-program/" target="_blank">he said in a statement</a>.\xa0\xa0\u201cHowever, we as Americans do not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents.\u201d</p>, <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)\xa0<a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/904755988204544002/photo/1" target="_blank">said in a Monday statement</a>\xa0he supported seeking a legislative solution to the plight of Dreamers, should Trump give Congress a six-month window to act.</p>, <p>\u201cI have always believed DACA was presidential overreach. However, I equally understand the plight of Dream Act kids who \u2015 for all practical purposes \u2015 know no country other than America,\u201d said Graham.\xa0</p>, <p>Some Republicans are also pushing for the Recognizing America\u2019s Children Act, or RAC Act, which they\u2019re calling a conservative answer to the Dream Act. It similarly would allow Dreamers to receive legal status and eventually become eligible for citizenship, but would have narrower eligibility requirements. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) plans to introduce the bill in the Senate in the coming weeks; Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), a moderate member, has already introduced it in the House. It also has backing outside Congress:\xa0Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) <a href="https://twitter.com/FLGovScott/status/903740687472091137" target="_blank">came out in support</a> of the bill last week.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are GOP members who would likely support legislation for Dreamers as standalone bills, without other conditions. But most have said they would only vote on bills that help undocumented immigrants if Congress first addresses border security or enforcement measures \u2015 if they would vote for them at all. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have previously supported bills coupling border security and enforcement with legal status for undocumented immigrants. But they\u2019d likely only go so far \u2015 Democratic leaders have dismissed an idea floated by the White House to protect Dreamers in exchange for slashing legal immigration numbers, funding Trump\u2019s border wall and increasing other deportation efforts. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have argued Dreamers shouldn\u2019t be used as a bargaining chip, and young undocumented immigrant activists agree. That means Democrats and advocates may eventually be forced into a bind of their own over whether to sell out other immigrants to protect Dreamers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standalone bills that support Dreamers could likely get enough support to pass, but that would probably require a large number of Democratic votes and a smaller proportion of Republicans. Ryan and McConnell would have to bring those bills for a vote for it to happen. Whether they want to remains to be seen. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of the Republican opposition to DACA, it has saved them for five years from having to actually do anything to support the Dreamers they say should be helped. That might be why some of them didn\u2019t want Trump to end it.</span></p>, <p><em>This story has been updated to include a comment from Sen. Lindsey Graham.</em></p>, <p><em><strong>CORRECTION:\xa0</strong>A previous version of this story stated that House Speaker Paul Ryan did not allow a House vote on an immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013. In fact, that decision was made by his predecessor, John Boehner.</em></p>]

He will announce his decision on Tuesday, according to the White House. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slatery said that while he believes a legal challenge to DACA will prevail, he won\u2019t join one. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThere is a human element to this ... that is not lost on me and should not be ignored,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMany of the DACA recipients, some of whose records I reviewed, have outstanding accomplishments and laudable ambitions, which if achieved, will be of great benefit and service to our country.\u201d </span></p>, <p>Slatery went on to urge Corker and Alexander to give \u201cserious consideration\u201d to the Dream Act, a bill that would allow young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to gain legal status and eventually become eligible for citizenship. Slatery specifically referenced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1615?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22s1615%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1">bill</a>, introduced by Sens.

House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-daca-dreamers_us_59a86e41e4b0dfaafceef55a?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the president should not end DACA and that Republicans were \u201cworking on\u201d a bill to address Dreamers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dream Act is only one of the legislative options available. The Recognizing America\u2019s Children, or RAC, Act was introduced in the House as a Dream Act alternative that would also grant Dreamers a path to citizenship, but with more restrictions on eligibility. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) is </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/31/politics/trump-daca-congress-action/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similar legislation. There is also a stopgap bill called the Bridge Act that would extend DACA-like protections on a temporary basis. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Slatery has backed off his threat of legal action, other attorneys general have not. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), who led the effort, </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/08/31/paxton-deadline-trump-decide-daca-still-stands/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has remained firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the ultimatum.</span></p>, <p>Attorneys general from Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia, as well as Idaho Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter, joined Paxton and Slatery on the letter threatening legal action.</p>, <p>Immigrant rights advocates plan to protest in some of those states to pressure their attorneys general to similarly back off the legal threat.\xa0</p>, <p>Slatery previously <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/06/ag-passes-refugee-lawsuit-but-state-presses/86773822/" target="_blank">declined to file a suit</a> against the government over refugee resettlement after the Tennessee state legislature voted to approve one in 2016.

They often cite the chilling effect that this type of cooperation has on undocumented immigrants\u2019 willingness to report or help solve crimes and the legal challenges inherent in holding someone without an arrest warrant.</p>, <p>Gillespie\u2019s ad about a vote on these localities is at once his most striking use of the immigration-driven politics that elected Trump and his least-significant policy shift.</p>, <p>Gillespie had already declared his <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/14/ed-gillespie-promises-to-be-strong-on-immigration-/">opposition</a> to cities restricting immigration cooperation while running against Stewart in May.

But the decision wouldn\u2019t take effect for six months, raising the prospect that Trump could change his mind or Congress could work on a legislative solution \u2015 and prolonging uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of people protected by the program.</p>, <p>On Sunday, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/03/trump-dreamers-immigration-daca-immigrants-242301" target="_blank">Politico</a>\xa0and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2017-09-03/trump-to-scrap-protection-for-dreamers-give-congress-six-months-to-fix" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reported that Trump plans to eventually terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which grants work permits and protections for so-called Dreamers, or undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children.</p>, <p>There will be a six-month delay to any enforcement of the president\u2019s decision, unnamed sources told\xa0<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/03/trump-dreamers-immigration-daca-immigrants-242301" target="_blank">Politico</a>\xa0and\xa0<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2017-09-03/trump-to-scrap-protection-for-dreamers-give-congress-six-months-to-fix" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, which would give Trump ample time to reverse his decision or decline to follow through on it. Otherwise, Congress would have to pass legislation during that gap if they want to keep protections for DACA recipients in place. Dreamers might not know for months whether or how their lives could be upended.\xa0</p>, <p>The White House is expected to officially announce Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday.</p>, <p>The decision would run against the recommendation of some Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-daca-dreamers_us_59a86e41e4b0dfaafceef55a?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009">said Friday that Trump should</a>\xa0keep DACA in place while Congress works on a legislative solution.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program, often referred to as DACA, allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. before they turned 16 to apply for two-year work authorization and reprieve from deportation. Since President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012, nearly 800,000 people have been granted those protections, which meant they could obtain driver\u2019s licenses, work legally and live without the imminent threat of being returned to countries they hadn\u2019t seen since childhood.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump\u2019s decision comes ahead of an informal Sept. 5 deadline set by state attorneys general who\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dreamers-daca_us_59557545e4b02734df31197d">threatened legal action</a>\xa0if the president did not suspend DACA by that time.</span></p>, <p>But supporters of DACA, including members of Congress and immigrant rights groups, said Trump could have fought for the program in court \u2015 or even waited to see if the states actually followed through on a legal challenge. They\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-daca_us_599f21f3e4b05710aa5ad224" target="_blank">made a last-ditch push</a>\xa0to persuade him to maintain DACA. Instead, the president\u2019s decision could put those hundreds of thousands of Dreamers in limbo.</p>, <p>Trump said repeatedly during his presidential campaign that he would end DACA \u2015 which he argued was unconstitutional \u2015 immediately upon becoming president. But he also spoke often about Dreamers in a vague but positive way, hinting that he favored action to support them. Last December, Trump said he would \u201c<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-daca-dreamers_us_58481963e4b0d0df18372021" target="_blank">work something out</a>\u201d for Dreamers. In February, he said he would \u201c<a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/trump-were-going-to-show-great-heart-daca" target="_blank">show great heart</a>\u2033 toward them. In April, he said Dreamers should \u201c<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/21/trump-dreamers-rest-easy-immigration-237463" target="_blank">rest easy</a>\u201d because his focus was deporting criminals.\xa0</p>, <p>White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said\xa0<span tabindex="0">on Thursday</span>\xa0ahead of the announcement that Trump \u201cabsolutely\u201d stood by his commitment to treat Dreamers with heart.</p>, <p>The president has kept DACA going for months in spite of his previous claims that it was illegal. From January through March, during most of which he was president, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved nearly 125,000 people for DACA, most of them for renewal.</p>, <p>DACA recipients have not been entirely safe, however, under the Trump administration. Immigrant rights advocates said there has been an uptick in the detention of Dreamers since the president took over and began an expansion of deportation efforts.</p>, <p>Without DACA,\xa0all Dreamers would be at risk of deportation. Trump officials have said no individuals are exempt from removal, and have sought to deport people who merely cross their paths even if they haven\u2019t otherwise committed a crime. Trump wants to deport more undocumented immigrants, and more DACA recipients will likely be among them.</p>, <p>There could also be major economic implications. If DACA recipients are unable to renew their work permits, nearly 700,000 people who are currently employed would exit the workforce. An average of 1,400 people would lose work authorization each business day and more than 6,000 could be fired in the first week alone, according to a\xa0<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release/2017/08/28/437944/release-daca-recipients-economic-educational-gains-continue-grow-according-largest-study-date/" target="_blank">recent report</a>\xa0by FWD.us and the Center for American Progress, both supporters of the program.</p>, <p>Deporting Dreamers is not a popular move \u2015 even among Republicans and Trump supporters,\xa0<a href="https://morningconsult.com/2017/06/16/poll-trumps-decision-dreamers-popular-one-even-among-base/" target="_blank">according to polling</a>. Nearly two-thirds of all Americans support DACA,\xa0according to a\xa0<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/poll-most-oppose-trump-s-pardon-ex-sheriff-arpaio-booting-n797526" target="_blank">NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll</a>.\xa0That means there is a chance Congress will step in and protect Dreamers, although it\u2019s not clear the White House would buy in without major concessions from Democrats on a border wall, immigration enforcement and cuts to legal immigration. Such a deal was reportedly being pushed by top White House officials, but Democrats\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-daca-dreamers_us_599c6eade4b06a788a2c3b72" target="_blank">quickly shot it down</a>\xa0at the time, saying Dreamers should not be used as bargaining chips.</p>, <p>The White House has not supported other bipartisan efforts to help Dreamers that don\u2019t have additional items attached, such as the stopgap Bridge Act, which would temporarily extend protections, or the Dream Act, which would put them on a path to legal status and potential citizenship.</p>, <p>Congressional Republicans have repeatedly blocked efforts to grant legal protections to Dreamers, but will be under increased pressure to do so after Trump\u2019s announcement. Ahead of the decision, some Republican lawmakers said they planned to work on more legislation that focuses on Dreamers.\xa0</p>, <p>Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) intends to introduce what some backers are touting as a conservative version of the Dream Act, called the Recognizing America\u2019s Children, or RAC Act, which was already introduced in the House and would grant legal status to a slightly narrower category of young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\xa0</p>, <p>Ryan, the House speaker, said\xa0<span tabindex="0">Friday</span>\xa0he also wants to pass a bill on Dreamers.\xa0\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThere are people in limbo,\u201d Ryan said on WCLO radio in Janesville, Wisconsin. \u201cThese are kids that know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don\u2019t know another home, and so I really do believe there needs to be a legislative solution, that\u2019s one that we\u2019re working on.\u201d</p>]

A year after the storm, the <a href="https://www.riskproject.org/">Resilience in Survivors of Katrina (RISK) Project</a> found that <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/hurricane-katrina-s-psychological-scars-revealed-1.18234">nearly half</a> of the 392 low-income parents they studied reported symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). An <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3276074/">associated study</a> concluded that the rates of probable serious mental illness in low-income parents in New Orleans doubled in the aftermath of the hurricane, a rise that\u2019s likely to be reflected in southeast Texas.</p>, <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of fear and anxiety about the future. And so we\u2019re seeing a lot of very anxious people who are not sure what they\u2019ll find when they return to their homes,\u201d said Annalee Gulley, the director of public policy and government affairs for Mental Health America of Greater Houston. She has been working to coordinate the mental and behavioral health response at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston, where thousands of Harvey evacuees are <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/08/31/houston-hurricane-shelters-remain-home-and-lifeline-thousands/">still sheltering</a>.</p>, <p>Gulley explained to HuffPost that the mental health responders at the center are facing the challenges of helping people with existing mental health diagnoses continue to get treatment and responding to new trauma caused by the storm.</p>, <p>Many evacuees were unable to grab medications when they rushed to safety, so CVS, Walgreens and Walmart have <a href="http://www.homeworldbusiness.com/retailers-aid-hurricane-harvey-victims/">made donations</a> to help people who have mental health diagnoses. For those who may have suffered new trauma, clinical social workers walk the halls of the convention center, where signs are posted that show the symptoms of PTSD.</p>, <p>After Hurricane Katrina, mental health professionals were able to learn more about how disasters affect mental health, lessons that they are now applying to help the survivors of Hurricane Harvey.</p>, <p>Dr. Melissa Allen, the medical director of the UTHealth Harris County Psychiatric Center, has been working to care for survivors of the storm. She said that, while people\u2019s reactions to disasters are very individual, there were indications of higher rates of substance abuse, anxiety and depression among Katrina survivors. People who were exposed to disaster zones for longer and received less support afterward were more likely to suffer mental health problems.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest lessons of Katrina, Allen said, was that it was crucial to have resources ready before the disaster hit. In the aftermath, even basic needs \u2015 clothes, shoes, toothbrushes \u2015 can help restore survivors\u2019 sense of safety.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many of the faculty in the hospital, Allen\u2019s house was flooded, and she had to evacuate with her children.\xa0</span>She said that working in the hospital has actually distracted her from dwelling on the destruction in the city.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt allows us to be of use in a situation where many of us are feeling kind of helpless, and just being able to give back and do something is a very positive thing,\u201d she told HuffPost.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of major traumatic events, such as Harvey and Katrina, survivors may begin to experience symptoms including intense or unpredictable feelings, changes in thought and behavior, trouble sleeping and a sense of isolation. Allen said that some of her patients were struggling with anxiety, confusion, a sense of loss or depression, but she added that survivors could have a wide range of emotions and that early intervention could help mitigate the psychological effects.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children, in particular, are vulnerable. The trauma of the storm itself might be combined with the stress of dislocation and the disruption of routines. Children </span><a href="http://www.nctsn.org/trauma-types/natural-disasters/floods#q2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may become</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more worried, fearful, aggressive or withdrawn. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIn children, the loss of their normal routine and their sense of safety is really disruptive, and it can be a very confusing time,\u201d Allen said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to re-establish a sense of normalcy as soon as possible, and to talk with a child who has been through something like this and see what it is they need, what they feel like happened, and just be there to reassure that they are in a safe place now.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to provide a space where children can feel safe to have such conversations, Mental Health America of Greater Houston has set up two children\u2019s zones in the convention center. Children can go into the areas to play, feel secure and to talk to professionals about their experiences.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe\u2019re asking licensed clinical social workers, licensed marriage and family therapists, and other medical professionals to go in and make sure that these children still have the ability to be kids while they\u2019re here in the shelter,\u201d Gulley said. \u201cAnd also to begin to have the conversations regarding what they\u2019ve experienced, what they\u2019ve seen, and what their families might be facing in the days and months to come.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the psychological effects of hurricanes are undeniable, being aware of the problems and responding appropriately can make a difference. In the face of destruction, Allen said, it is important for people to take time to mourn their losses. That could mean anything from losing possessions to losing loved ones, including those who have died, are missing or have had to relocate far from family. It is also important for survivors to ask for help when they need it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allen explained that helping with the community recovery effort and listening to survivors\u2019 needs is crucial. The </span><a href="http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/lp/hurricane-harvey-health-professionals"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Red Cross</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is calling on mental health professionals to volunteer to help storm survivors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><a href="https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/August-2017/Helping-Others-Through-Catastrophic-Stress"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Alliance on Mental Illness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is providing hotlines for people affected by the storm.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThe more people that are available to help out, the easier it is to reestablish a sense of normalcy,\u201d Allen said. \u201cSo don\u2019t be afraid to ask for support from your community and those around you.\u201d</span></p>]

Still, he said, \u201cit\u2019s good that he\u2019s showing his face.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Later on Saturday, Trump arrived in Lake Charles, Louisiana, to survey rescue and recovery efforts in a southwestern corner of the state struck by Harvey\u2019s second landfall this week.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always great to have the president in your state for any reason but to acknowledge the work done by so many people here,\u201d Louisiana Gov.

Here are the components of North Korea\u2019s developing nuclear program, and the West\u2019s efforts to stop it.</p>, <p>North Korea has been working to acquire a functional, deliverable nuclear weapon for decades. Those aspirations <a href="http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/north-korea/">began during the rule of former Supreme Leader Kim Il Sung</a> at the close of World War II and began to take shape under the reign of his son, Kim Jong Il, who first tested a nuclear weapon in 2006.</p>, <p class="p1">As New York Times reporter David Sanger explained in <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/03/29/521909787/the-u-s-has-an-active-cyber-war-underway-to-thwart-the-north-korean-nuclear-thre">an interview with NPR\u2019s Dave Davies</a>\xa0in late March:\xa0</p>, <p class="p2">\u201cKim Il Sung remembers that General [Douglas] MacArthur, during the Korean War, wanted to use nuclear weapons against North Korea and China. He was stopped from doing this. But it made a very big impression on Mr. Kim, and he knew that North Korea, to survive and deter attack, needed to have this capability itself. And he\u2019s the one, the grandfather of the current North Korean leader, who started down this path.\u201d</p>, <p class="p1">The North was able to purchase much of its initial nuclear technology from one of the founders of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear program and bought centrifuges to enrich uranium from Libya.\xa0</p>, <p class="p1">The North is in possession of <a href="https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2017/global-nuclear-weapons-modernization-remains-priority" target="_blank">up to 20 nuclear warheads</a>, according to an annual report released this week by the <a href="https://www.sipri.org/" target="_blank">Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a>.</p>, <p>North Korea has so far conducted six nuclear weapons tests, all at an underground test site in the country\u2019s northeast called Punggye-ri.

While the tests are meant to fine-tune the North Korean arsenal, they also serve a political purpose.</p>, <p class="p1">Several of the recent tests have been timed to coincide with important strategic moments for the region.</p>, <p class="p1">The\xa0<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/mar-a-lago-north-korea-trump.html">one in February</a>\xa0coincided with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Another one,\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-missile_us_58e41d3ce4b03a26a3674483">in April</a>, was timed ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to the U.S. Yet another launch in March was conducted in retaliation for joint U.S.-South Korean military drills. The July 3rd missile test \u2015 Pyongyang\u2019s 11th this year \u2015 was launched on the eve of U.S. Independence Day, and days before the G-20 summit in Europe. Kim dubbed it\xa0\u201c<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/05/a-gift-for-the-american-bastards-north-koreas-kim-fires-back-at-trump" target="_blank">a gift for the American bastards</a>.\u201d\xa0Three weeks later, the July 28 test came a day after the North Korean holiday \u201cDay of Victory,\u201d which marks the 1953 ceasefire in the Korean War.</p>, <p class="p1">The North also <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-missile-test_us_599c7c01e4b06a788a2c7df2" target="_blank">launched</a> three short-range missiles into the sea off its east coast on Aug. 25, intensifying the harsh rhetoric between the regime and Trump. And on Aug. 28, it <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-missile-japan_us_59a4874fe4b050afa90c1eab" target="_blank">fired</a> an intermediate range missile over northern Japan.</p>, <p class="p1">Pyongyang is flexing muscles that experts say are getting bigger.</p>, <p>North Korea\u2019s nuclear aspirations, experts say, hinge on Kim\u2019s desire to retain control of the isolated nation.</p>, <p class="p1">\u201cAbove all else, North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is about security,\u201d John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37321686">told the BBC</a> last September. \u201cIt is, by their estimation, the only reliable guarantee of the country\u2019s basic sovereignty, of the Communist regime\u2019s control, and of the rule of Kim Jong-un.\u201d</p>, <p class="p1">Sanger, the Times reporter, echoed that view on \u201cFresh Air\u201d:</p>, <p class="p3">\u201cIf you consider your objectives to be to assure regime survival, to make sure that North Korea remains the Kim family\u2019s personal fiefdom, then they\u2019ve pursued a pretty rational strategy, one in which loyalty is above all, in which even members of the family who challenge the leadership end up getting executed. And under that structure, the North Koreans, for an unstable, irrational regime have played a pretty good game since 1953.\u201d</p>, <p>Kim has continued weapons tests despite increasingly strict condemnations from the international community. In January, the United Nations imposed its \u201c<a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12603.doc.htm">toughest ever</a>\u201d sanctions on the country in an attempt to stifle the program.\xa0It issued its latest round of sanctions restricting foreign trade and exports of certain goods on Aug. 5, after the second ICBM test.</p>, <p>But such actions have failed in the past.</p>, <p>Last<strong>\xa0</strong>September, former U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the North\u2019s actions in recent years had led to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/world/asia/north-korea-ban-ki-moon.html" target="_blank">unprecedented state of turmoil</a> in the region.</p>, <p>\u201cNever in the past have I ever seen such kind of heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Ban said.</p>, <p>In light of Sunday\u2019s test, South Korea has called for the\xa0<a data-beacon-parsed="true" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41139445" target="_blank">\u201cstrongest possible\u201d response</a>\xa0from the international community, including new sanctions to \u201ccompletely isolate\u201d Pyongyang.</p>, <p>Trump tweeted Sunday morning that the hermit kingdom\u2019s \u201cwords and actions continue to be <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/904305644651634688" target="_blank">very hostile and dangerous</a> to the United States.\u201d He also continued his criticism of China\u2019s role in the defusing the situation, tweeting Beijing is \u201ctrying to help but with <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/904307898213433344" target="_blank">little success</a>.\u201d</p>, <p class="p1">Under Obama, the United States tread carefully and refrained from any direct action against Kim\u2019s regime. As a member of the United Nations Security Council, the U.S.\xa0helped increase sanctions against North Korea following its September 2016 nuclear test.</p>, <p class="p1">\u201cThe United States is realistic about what this resolution will achieve. No resolution in New York will likely, tomorrow, persuade Pyongyang to cease its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons,\u201d former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-nuclear-un-idUSKBN13P1TF" target="_blank">said at the time</a>.

You want to get the technology capable of scaling to meet the demand, which means you have to have some understanding of what the demand is. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to have your operations working, which means that all of the policy changes that have been made throughout the year have to be implemented well on the website, have to be implemented well on the call center, and you need enough call center capacity.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And third, you need your outreach machine working well, which means that you are beginning to notify people of changes they need to be aware of. For example, if they\u2019ve had a plan change because there\u2019s a new plan in their market or their plan no longer exists, they\u2019ve got an IRS issue that you want to make them aware of, you want to make sure they\u2019re aware of the new dates for open enrollment because they\u2019ve changed, and that you\u2019ve engaged local assisters and in-person help. And then, finally, that you\u2019ve done the marketing outreach. We would have very specific marketing deliverables already done and in the bag. Today, I don\u2019t think they are even underway yet.</span></p>, <p><strong>Based on what we know, what steps has the Trump administration taken to prepare for the 2018 open enrollment period? What haven\u2019t they done yet?</strong></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve done as it relates to technology, to start with, but our hope would be that they\u2019re planning for much bigger volume days than we\u2019ve had in the past because they\u2019ve cut the open enrollment season in half. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From an operations standpoint, unfortunately, we do know that they have closed two call centers \u2015 I assume that\u2019s about 800 people \u2015 which is going to have an impact on the ability to service the operation and service people and service people timely. What we don\u2019t know is how many people across all the call centers will be staffed, and one would hope that they\u2019re going to manage that also to a very high peak. That\u2019s a concern. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then third, from an outreach standpoint, I think one would hope that they are buying ad time, that they are starting to get emails out and that they would be engaged with their network of local assistors and local help. News reports suggest that they have canceled contracts and have not engaged at the local level yet. So that\u2019s the picture we have at this point.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of people, right? There are people that have policies that are renewing and you can sub-segment them into different categories: people who have no changes, people whose current plan\u2019s no longer available, people who will be auto-enrolled into a different plan, people who wouldn\u2019t be auto-enrolled into a different plan. And they need a fair amount of effort and hand-holding and outreach and communication, just to renew folks. And the first thing to be concerned about is that it takes a lot of effort to explain to people what their choices are as they renew. I think that\u2019s the first step.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second step is people who are going to enroll but have never enrolled in the exchanges before. Those are typically going to be people who need to be informed and educated because they are probably not aware that there are affordable options available to them or what their tax credit subsidies are. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We launched in the past important tools like window shopping [for health insurance policies], and we have done a lot of outreach and hired celebrities and had people in local communities and done all kinds of things to try to reach people. We do know that when they have awareness of how affordable it is to enroll, that you get a lot of people that enroll. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it\u2019s a pretty big payoff for the marketing and outreach efforts, and I think in that area we\u2019ve got reason to be pessimistic based on all the actions we\u2019ve seen so far. Whether they\u2019ve cut that back severely or whether they\u2019re going to cut it back entirely, one doesn\u2019t know, but that\u2019s going to have an impact on being able to reach new people.</span></p>, <p><strong>How would you characterize the state of the health insurance exchanges at the end of the Obama administration?</strong></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2015 and 2016 were years when the exchanges were underpriced [customers used more medical care than the insurers expected when they set prices], and so 2017 was the year of some necessary rate increases. While those were painful for some people, the good news is that put the exchanges in the position of stability. The exchanges are on relatively solid ground now. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think there are four or five states that are smaller, that are rural. I think those are states that have historically suffered from competition problems. But, by and large, many of the states are competitive and in as healthy a position as they\u2019ve been in for a while. </span></p>, <p><strong>How do you differentiate between problems on the exchanges that remain from the previous administration and what we\u2019re seeing now?</strong></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I\u2019ll say this: States that want to make the ACA succeed and set up the ACA, they\u2019re doing a lot better. So if you\u2019re in a state that\u2019s expanded Medicaid and if you\u2019re in a state that has its own state-based exchange, generally speaking you have much lower rates and you have many more competitors. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you\u2019re a state that folded your arms and said, \u201cI want no part of this. I\u2019m going to let the federal government do everything, and I\u2019m not going to expand Medicaid,\u201d then you have a very different situation. Your rates are going to be higher, you\u2019re going to have fewer competitors and it\u2019s just not going to feel like an environment where insurers want to compete. For one, even before you look at the attitude change at the federal government level, states have set their own course. The Republican states are not the ones that have taken advantage of those things, by and large, and the states that have really taken the bull by the horns initially, I think they\u2019re having better outcomes. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That\u2019s the first part. The second part is that, this year, you can measure the impact on rates from actions the Trump administration has specifically chosen to take. Really, even if you just limit it to two actions: the decision to not enforce the individual mandate vigorously or leave it very ambivalent, and then the not making a commitment to pay for cost-sharing reductions. You know, those things have been estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, and certainly backed up by other independent analysts, as as much as half to two-thirds of all the rate increases. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not to say that there aren\u2019t the normal fluctuations and ups and downs of markets \u2015 because, you know, markets aren\u2019t perfect, the ACA is a private market solution, so it\u2019s going to suffer from imperfections that are in markets. But when you add on top of those normal imperfections the self-inflicted wounds of as much as 30 percent additional premiums, that\u2019s the stuff you can point to the Trump administration and say, \u201cHey, we didn\u2019t need to have that. We can get rid of that.\u201d</span></p>, <p><strong>Why does the federal government need to do any of this? Why can\u2019t people who need health insurance take care of it themselves? And why can\u2019t we rely on health insurance companies to market and promote their own products, like companies in other markets do?</strong></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, look, I think it\u2019s a little bit of everybody\u2019s job. But an important part of this question is: Why is it in the federal government\u2019s best interest to focus on outreach and marketing? And I\u2019ll give you a few reasons. The first one is because the ACA is funded by user fees [paid by health insurance companies]. These are funds that are intended to be used to make the marketplace work. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way to keep the market functioning and healthy is to continually get new young, healthy people to enroll. And if you don\u2019t, you risk prices going up. And when prices go up, subsidies that the federal government pays go up. So it\u2019s a very wise investment from the federal government to invest in things that are going to reduce outlays. That\u2019s the second reason. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the third reason is \u2015 just like any other government program, like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid \u2015 informing people of their rights and their benefits and making a process simple and easy for them is the role of the federal government, to a certain extent. So providing in-person assistance, language assistance for people who don\u2019t speak English as their first language, and all of those things \u2015 it\u2019s all part and parcel of providing a benefit.</span></p>, <p><strong>What should health insurance consumers who use the marketplaces expect, what do they need to know and how should they get ready to shop around and choose policies for next year?</strong></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the good news is that there\u2019s going to be many more options and many more affordable options for more people than probably ever before. So I think the challenge is that people who listen to the media or only pay passing attention, they may think the ACA\u2019s been repealed, they may think \u2015 if they listen to the words of the president \u2015 that it\u2019s exploding, or they may believe that there aren\u2019t very many options available. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, the reality is, for most Americans who buy insurance through the exchange, their subsidies, their tax credits give them access to very likely even more affordable coverage than prior years, that there are sufficient options in most locations, that most Americans live in areas where there is a lot of competition. So the news is actually quite good for people if they are able to get past some of the rhetoric that\u2019s out there. Now, there\u2019s obviously variation around this, and I think particularly for people in rural areas, the picture\u2019s not as good. And in some small states, there are some challenges that don\u2019t exist in some of the bigger states. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, the administration or the Congress will resolve the cost-sharing reduction payment issue, and, if they do, then I think we\u2019ll see more affordable rates. If they don\u2019t, then sadly people will be asked to pay more than they need to because of an administration policy.</span></p>, <p><strong>What\u2019s your prediction of how open enrollment will turn out for 2018? Is it already too late for there to be a successful open enrollment period?</strong></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It\u2019s not too late. I mean, I think if the administration decided to take ownership of open enrollment and aim for it to be successful, I\u2019m quite confident that they can. The investments are modest. It\u2019s just a matter of deciding to do a good job versus deciding not to care. But all the pieces are in place for that to happen. The good news is people want to be insured, so you\u2019re not doing something that is an unnatural act. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If they simply decide that they want to achieve a goal of covering more Americans, I\u2019m quite confident that they have the staff, the resources, the process and the technology to do that. So if we have anything less than that, I think it will be a choice that they will have made to say that that\u2019s not an important goal.</span></p>]

He will announce his decision on Tuesday, according to the White House. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slatery said that while he believes a legal challenge to DACA will prevail, he won\u2019t join one. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThere is a human element to this ... that is not lost on me and should not be ignored,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMany of the DACA recipients, some of whose records I reviewed, have outstanding accomplishments and laudable ambitions, which if achieved, will be of great benefit and service to our country.\u201d </span></p>, <p>Slatery went on to urge Corker and Alexander to give \u201cserious consideration\u201d to the Dream Act, a bill that would allow young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to gain legal status and eventually become eligible for citizenship. Slatery specifically referenced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1615?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22s1615%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1">bill</a>, introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and said it was \u201cnot a comprehensive answer to our immigration policy challenges, but ... would be a very good start.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIt is my sincere hope that the important issues raised by the States will be resolved by the people\u2019s representatives in the halls of Congress, not in a courtroom,\u201d Slatery wrote.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Sept. 5 approaches, more Republicans have said Trump should leave DACA in place and seek a legislative fix instead. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-daca-dreamers_us_59a86e41e4b0dfaafceef55a?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the president should not end DACA and that Republicans were \u201cworking on\u201d a bill to address Dreamers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dream Act is only one of the legislative options available. The Recognizing America\u2019s Children, or RAC, Act was introduced in the House as a Dream Act alternative that would also grant Dreamers a path to citizenship, but with more restrictions on eligibility. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) is </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/31/politics/trump-daca-congress-action/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">working on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> similar legislation. There is also a stopgap bill called the Bridge Act that would extend DACA-like protections on a temporary basis. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Slatery has backed off his threat of legal action, other attorneys general have not. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), who led the effort, </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/08/31/paxton-deadline-trump-decide-daca-still-stands/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has remained firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the ultimatum.</span></p>, <p>Attorneys general from Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia, as well as Idaho Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter, joined Paxton and Slatery on the letter threatening legal action.</p>, <p>Immigrant rights advocates plan to protest in some of those states to pressure their attorneys general to similarly back off the legal threat.\xa0</p>, <p>Slatery previously <a href="http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/07/06/ag-passes-refugee-lawsuit-but-state-presses/86773822/" target="_blank">declined to file a suit</a> against the government over refugee resettlement after the Tennessee state legislature voted to approve one in 2016.

His phone was ringing.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he was asleep, Hurricane Harvey had slammed into the greater Houston area, bringing extreme winds and heavy rainfall. His bosses wanted him back at the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Houston \u2015 ASAP.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was one problem, though. Brownlee, 34, was already flooded in. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cEvery road that I could take to get in was impassable,\u201d he said. So his team pulled the maneuver they knew best: They scrambled a rescue aircraft and picked him up in an elementary school parking lot near his house.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI came in, put my uniform on, grabbed my gear, a crew, a helicopter,\u201d and took off, he said, flying the first of what would be many rescue missions in the days to come.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full extent of Harvey\u2019s devastation is still unknown. More than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">32,000 residents have sought refuge in shelters after being displaced from their homes, and at least 38 people have died. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But many more were saved \u2015 including by pilots like Brownlee. So far, more than </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/31/us/harvey-houston-texas-flood/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">72,000 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0have been rescued. According to a U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson, at least 744 aerial rescues in the greater Houston area have taken place since the storm began.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, one week after Harvey made landfall in Texas as a C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ategory 4 hurricane, Brownlee\u2019s unit took HuffPost reporters </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a reconnaissance mission to survey flooding around </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/small-towns-harvey_us_59a968ade4b0354e4409bf79?m9l" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Port Arthur and Beaumont</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two cities among those hit hardest. Much of the area surrounding these towns is still underwater, and rescue efforts are ongoing.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky was sunny and clear as the MH-65 Dolphin helicopter took off \u2015 a far cry from the flying conditions that Brownlee battled during the storm. On Monday, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> flew a search and rescue mission through a torrential downpour, the worst weather he\u2019d ever witnessed as a pilot. He couldn\u2019t see anything except the ground directly below the nose of the aircraft. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe were using Google Maps to fly above highways, because we know that there are no towers over the highways,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to forget that experience.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seen from the sky, the destruction caused by Harvey was on full display. Mile after mile brought scenes of dramatic flooding, with entire fields and neighborhoods swallowed up by water.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cows congregated on tiny sections of dry land, surrounded by water. Interstate 10, a major connecting highway, was a river. Tractor-trailer trucks stood abandoned along the road. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Cybulski, a flight mechanic who has been with the Coast Guard for 19 years, kept his eyes trained on the ground, looking for anyone in need of rescue. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The destruction, he said, reminded him of the 11 days he spent responding to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, in 2005.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe would get the smells from downtown \u2015 the winds would shift and the smell of death would come,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing here, it brings back the emotions, for sure.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only thing they had to drink during the Katrina mission was blue Gatorade, he said. To this day, he can\u2019t stand the stuff.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Beaumont, a line of cars snaked around the block, waiting for supplies at a distribution center. Outside a housing complex, a high-water vehicle pushed through deep water. Another Coast Guard helicopter flew past, transporting a victim who\u2019d just been rescued.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast Guard rescue workers had been working nonstop since the hurricane made landfall. Many of them left families behind. One serviceman\u2019s wife was in labor as he worked to aid his community. Several Guardsmen at Ellington Field lost homes and vehicles of their own, while others, such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybulski, were initially unable to get to the air base to help because of severe flooding. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis one caught a lot of people off guard,\u201d </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybulski said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> \u201cI don\u2019t think the Houston area was expecting something of this magnitude \u2015 this much rain.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brownlee said he was humbled after flying over Houston early on in the storm. He didn\u2019t see any damage, and although he was ready to act at a moment\u2019s notice, he figured the worst was over. Hours later, he\u2019d wake up to a call demanding that he get back to his chopper.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cMy famous last words were, \u2018Hurricane Harvey is going to be nothing,\u2019\u201d he said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He would save 20 lives over the course of the next few days \u2015 three times as many people as he\u2019d rescued since he became a pilot three years ago.</span>\xa0\xa0</p>]

Five National Guard trucks, two large boats and two inflatable Zodiac watercraft were ready to deploy, as were members of volunteer rescue teams and state wildlife officials. Teams were preparing to head into small towns across the coastal region \u2015 places like Bridge City and Rose City.</p>, <p>Rose City is flooded, the city\u2019s mayor, Hernando Ramos, told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s flooded everywhere.\u201d\xa0That was about all he had to say on the subject, but Ken Bost, the city\u2019s deputy marshal, elaborated.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been at this since probably Friday, pulling people out of the water,\u201d Bost said. \u201cWe tried to get out in this interstate [I-10] today. It\u2019s impassable... There\u2019s pretty strong rapids... The city of Rose City... due to the flooding in high water, all of the city is under water. It\u2019s going to be more than likely it\u2019s a total loss. Till this water recedes, there\u2019s no way to get in it to recon it.\u201d</p>, <p>Harvey \u201cis probably 10 times worse than Ike,\u201d Gary Lamare, who lives in Rose City, said of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/hurricane-ike?mcubz=1" target="_blank">the 2008 hurricane</a>. \u201cI\u2019ve been here most of my life. I moved here when I was about 7 years old. I\u2019ve never seen nothing like this. It\u2019s devastating... I got family in Lake View. His house is 15 feet off the ground and they\u2019re saying it has water... We\u2019re going to survive it. The good Lord blessed us with our lives.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the 551</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Engineers Division of National Guard drove through streets flooded up to car windows, past half-submerged vehicles. Their mission was to rescue anyone still trapped who wanted to leave but to leave behind anyone who wanted to stay. \xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They\u2019d been warned to beware of snakes and alligators, since the area they were heading into was laced with bayous. </span></p>, <p>The guardsmen said colleagues had found \u201cat least two\u201d bodies the day before but hadn\u2019t been able to recover them. They wouldn\u2019t talk about details, and it was unclear if those bodies could be recovered Friday, either.</p>, <p>In nearby Port Arthur, many roads were still swamped with waist-deep water. Beaumont was without running water, and flooded roads made it difficult for relief teams to get through.</p>, <p>Donna Porstne, media relations director for the health-focused relief organization Americares, told HuffPost the group got a team into Beaumont on Friday to transport a man in urgent need of dialysis treatment.</p>, <p>\u201cFlooding has made transportation difficult \u2015\xa0if not impossible \u2015 for many patients,\u201d Porstne said. \u201cSome treatment facilities have closed, and Americares is helping to get patients to facilities that are open and able to provide care. We are working closely with partner organizations that have the capability to transport patients by boat or helicopter if needed.\u201d</p>, <p>Back at the Orange County Emergency Services building, residents were stocking up on much-needed supplies \u2015 bottled water, diapers, toiletries.</p>, <p>Morgan Peterson, 29, evacuated here from her home in Vidor, Texas, with her dogs Duke and Cookie after the water began to rise at her house.</p>, <p>Beth Dougherty, 35, and her 2-year-old daughter, Natalee, were also at the emergency services building. Although their house hadn\u2019t flooded, it was surrounded by water, stranding them for days. Dougherty said she was able to get to the fire station and back to her house.

He will announce his decision on Tuesday, according to the White House. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slatery said that while he believes a legal challenge to DACA will prevail, he won\u2019t join one. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThere is a human element to this ... that is not lost on me and should not be ignored,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMany of the DACA recipients, some of whose records I reviewed, have outstanding accomplishments and laudable ambitions, which if achieved, will be of great benefit and service to our country.\u201d </span></p>, <p>Slatery went on to urge Corker and Alexander to give \u201cserious consideration\u201d to the Dream Act, a bill that would allow young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to gain legal status and eventually become eligible for citizenship. Slatery specifically referenced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1615?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22s1615%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1">bill</a>, introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and said it was \u201cnot a comprehensive answer to our immigration policy challenges, but ... would be a very good start.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cIt is my sincere hope that the important issues raised by the States will be resolved by the people\u2019s representatives in the halls of Congress, not in a courtroom,\u201d Slatery wrote.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Sept. 5 approaches, more Republicans have said Trump should leave DACA in place and seek a legislative fix instead. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-daca-dreamers_us_59a86e41e4b0dfaafceef55a?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the president should not end DACA and that Republicans were \u201cworking on\u201d a bill to address Dreamers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dream Act is only one of the legislative options available.

Hurricane Harvey had flooded the city, leaving many roads impassable and stranding thousands of people in their homes.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had already been three days since the storm hit. For\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">dozens of his young patients,\xa0going multiple days without treatment could be deadly.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braun\u2019s center is one of the country\u2019s largest clinics for children with kidney failure, providing care for babies through young adults. His patients rely on dialysis, a treatment that filters blood to remove waste and excess fluid, to stay alive. They need the treatment three to four days a week, with a maximum of two days between sessions. And without it, they can suffer severe consequences: hypertension, headaches, chest pain, vomiting and ultimately death.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He called Dr. Rita Swinford, the medical director of the pediatric dialysis unit at Children\u2019s Memorial Hermann Hospital, which is located just four blocks away in an area of southwest Houston known for its medical facilities. Swinford was also</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> panicking. Between their two units, they cared for virtually every child on dialysis in southeast Texas. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braun\u2019s patients had gotten their last treatment on Saturday, before the worst of the storm hit the city; Swinford\u2019s had been treated on Friday. Time was running out, and t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hey needed a plan. Thirty-three of their patients were critically overdue for dialysis and desperately needed to get to a unit. They\u2019d have to find a way to transport those children and their families, who were spread all over the region, to the centers, in just one day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cMany, many families were flooded in, either their homes were flooding or flooded, or they were trapped in their neighborhoods and they couldn\u2019t get out,\u201d Braun said. Six of the patients were under age 2. Some of them were on ventilators, and others had medical complications beyond kidney failure.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He called the Coast Guard and gave them a list of patients, addresses and phone numbers. Their mission was to track down all 33 and help them get to the hospital for dialysis \u2015 before it was too late.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt.\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Bryan, the Coast Guard liaison to the Texas State Emergency Operations Center, said they immediately started working\xa0</span>with the Texas Department of Emergency Management to create a map of Houston that pinpointed the location of each child, with color coding based on their criticality.</p>, <p>\u201cWe very quickly realized that we had 33 children randomly scattered all across Houston in locations that were basically islands surrounded by rapidly rising flood waters,\u201d Bryan said.\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThis was mission impossible, because it was such a logistical nightmare.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they were quickly able to deploy a sweeping rescue effort that included first responders from the Houston police and fire departments, the Coast Guard,\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Federal Emergency Management Agency rescue team and the United States Air Force.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the patients they were able to save was 16-year-old Inesty Thomas. By Monday evening, she had been waiting for treatment for two days, and she was feeling weak and achy.

And historically, I like following my instincts,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut all my life I\u2019ve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office \u2015 in other words, when you\u2019re president of the United States.\u201d</p>, <p>He went on to say that he would be sending more troops \u2015 estimates have suggested around 4,000 \u2015 without committing to any deadlines for pulling out.</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s U-turn came as bad news to Erik Prince, founder of the private security company formerly called Blackwater, whose employees were accused of committing a number of crimes during the Iraq War, including the killing of 14 Iraqi civilians in Nisour Square, Baghdad, on Sept. 16, 2007. The incident sparked numerous federal investigations, and Prince sold the company in 2010.</p>, <p>Now he\u2019s the chairman of Frontier Services Group, a logistics company based in the United Arab Emirates, and he feels newly emboldened by Trump\u2019s election. In May, the 48-year-old former Navy SEAL wrote an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-macarthur-model-for-afghanistan-1496269058" target="_blank">op-ed for The Wall Street Journal</a> advocating a completely different solution in Afghanistan. Prince\u2019s five-point plan suggested that, instead of sending U.S. troops,\xa0private contracted soldiers \u2015 including U.S. and NATO veterans, Prince has said elsewhere\xa0\u2015 should be used alongside U.S. Special Forces troops.\xa0They would serve under the command of a \u201cviceroy,\u201d who would coordinate all military strategy and report to the president.</p>, <p>\u201cThere are too many cooks,\u201d Prince wrote, outlining the financial waste (approximately $1 trillion) and the massive damage to U.S. lives (around 2,000 deaths and 20,000 injuries) since the war began 16 years ago.</p>, <p>Prince\u2019s views are popular with some inside the White House and on Capitol Hill, where he is scheduled to meet with 50 members of Congress next week. I met with him on Monday in Washington, D.C., to discuss how close he came to convincing the administration to go his way and what he plans to do for the rest of Trump\u2019s tenure. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>, <p><em><strong>Your Wall Street Journal piece got a lot of attention in Washington. Did you ever speak to the president about it?</strong></em></p>, <p>We didn\u2019t meet about it, but he read it, and I\u2019m told he circulated it around. I wrote it for an audience of one, and it worked.</p>, <p>This was after [national security adviser] H.R. McMaster had asked for 70,000, 80,000 troops. McMaster basically wanted a redo of the Obama surge, where we have tens of thousands of Americans come back to Afghanistan and do the fighting there. I think that\u2019s a bad idea. I think the president did, too.</p>, <p><em><strong>So Trump reads it. Then what happens?</strong></em></p>, <p>Well, I get calls from McMaster and from [then-White House chief strategist] Steve Bannon. They say, \u201cHey, the president saw your article. Please come in and tell us what you were thinking.\u201d So I came in, and I gave a presentation [to Bannon, McMaster and then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus] that fleshed out more of the points made in the op-ed and hit the notion of vetting contractors and all the rest.</p>, <p><em><strong>Your use of the word \u201cviceroy\u201d in the op-ed stirred up a lot of controversy, raising questions of colonial power and accountability. Surely, the Afghans would not want to answer to a viceroy?</strong></em></p>, <p>To be very clear, when I say a viceroy, that is not to rule over Afghanistan, but rather to harmonize what has been a very chaotic U.S. policy. Between the Department of Defense, the Department of State and the CIA in Afghanistan and Pakistan, there has been no unity of commands. Seventeen commanders in 16 years. Come on. It\u2019s a joke. It\u2019s embarrassing.</p>, <p><strong><em>Talk me through the timeline. You write the piece. You get called in to talk with McMaster and Bannon and Priebus and \u2026</em></strong></p>, <p>And H.R. automatically hates it.</p>, <p><em><strong>Does he say that to you?</strong></em></p>, <p>Pretty much.</p>, <p><em><strong>In other words, he\u2019s called you in because the president is interested in your ideas, not because he wants to meet you.</strong></em></p>, <p>Correct. I went through the slides, and he completely discounted it. The nature of the questions he asked made it clear that it was going to be an all-Army solution, period.</p>, <p><em><strong>Give me an example.</strong></em></p>, <p>I pointed out the challenge of deploying U.S. troops the way they had been for 16 years, where they go for six or nine months and they leave and all that local knowledge leaves with them.</p>, <p>Here\u2019s the thing. Every U.S. trooper is statistically at the highest risk for the first 60 days they\u2019re in country, because most of those guys, it\u2019s their first deployment and they\u2019re figuring it out. Meanwhile, the same Taliban that have been there for 16 years, the ones that have survived, are the smartest, most capable fighters.</p>, <p>They see the Americans come and go every six to nine months. They know exactly how they patrol. They know exactly how they clear mines. They know exactly how they communicate. They know exactly the response times for aircraft. They know the deal, so doing the same thing for another 16 or 17 years means the outcome is going to be the same. It\u2019s like the last two kids that were killed two weeks ago, blown up in a roadside bomb in their fully armored vehicle. Terrible. What a loss. What a waste.</p>, <p><em><strong>What was McMaster\u2019s response to that argument?</strong></em></p>, <p>He largely just refused to answer, and I wasn\u2019t there to debate him. I was there to pitch an idea.</p>, <p><em><strong>What happened after the meeting?</strong></em></p>, <p>Steve and Reince liked the concept. They saw it as something the president would or should consider. A couple weeks later, I got a call from Steve saying, \u201cOK, lay it out. Figure out what that costs. And tell me exactly because the typical Beltway pundits will discount a low number.\u201d</p>, <p>So I did a very hard number: 91 aircraft, 84,000 flight hours, all the food, fuel, ordinance, man days, insurance, 3,200 ground mentors [Special Forces members or contractors who attach to Afghan army battalions], the whole thing. It comes out to about five and a half thousand personnel. It was 7 percent of what they\u2019re spending now, way less than $4 billion.</p>, <p><em><strong>Still, if you got what you suggested, you\u2019d get a big cut from that, no?</strong></em></p>, <p>What I\u2019d say is that Elon Musk advocates for private space flight. Is he demonized for that? I would be very happy to compete for a solution that saves American lives and saves the taxpayers $40 billion a year. I will not apologize for that in any way. \xa0</p>, <p><em><strong>You wrote about the vulnerability of air power in Afghanistan. Presumably you also mentioned that in your meeting?</strong></em></p>, <p>Yes. The U.S. has completely failed to deliver on this. There is no adequate Afghan air force, ranging from maintenance deficiencies to pilot training shortages to operational support capability.</p>, <p>My old company, we used to have 26 aircraft in Afghanistan doing that kind of support for the U.S. Army. So even as large as the U.S. military is \u2015 and it\u2019s the most expensive military in the world \u2015 they still had a requirement for extra aviation capacity. So they rented it from the private sector. I thought, Why don\u2019t they let the Afghans do the same thing?</p>, <p>The premise of what I\u2019m laying out with ground mentors and with the air package is that they serve as an adjunct in the Afghan forces, wearing an Afghan uniform, Afghan rules of engagement. The premise of this is a true Afghan-ization.</p>, <p><strong><em>One big question is what happens if something goes wrong, like it did in Iraq with Blackwater. Who is accountable?</em></strong></p>, <p>Sure, if the guys do an evil act, they can be held to account under the Uniform Code of Military Justice with a trial held in Kabul. I thought long and hard about that. A cell of JAG [Judge Advocate General] lawyers can be detailed to handle this for the contractors that are there, just like they\u2019re there for any active duty forces.</p>, <p><em><strong>I assume your position on this is related to the yearslong case against a few Blackwater contractors for the killing of 14 people in Iraq.</strong></em></p>, <p>Well, a week and a half ago, the appeals court threw out the murder conviction [of Nicholas Slatten, who had been sentenced to life in prison], and they threw out the sentences of the other guys. It was a pretty stinging review of the federal government. They still have to be resentenced. I think they\u2019ll get time served.</p>, <p>The issue there was this: If the government had asked us, we would have preferred to be under the Uniform Code of Military Justice [which regularly tries military crimes where they occur], because all the guys that were doing that job were former military veterans. They know the deal. Having the trial close to battle makes way more sense than [having it] 7,000 miles away in a D.C. courtroom with people who have fortunately never seen the aftereffects of a car bomb. But the State Department prohibited that because they didn\u2019t want their people [civilian government employees] held under that standard.</p>, <p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>, <p>Don\u2019t get me started on the State Department.</p>, <p><em><strong>Why?</strong></em></p>, <p>It was a turf issue between the agencies. Leave it at that.</p>, <p><em><strong>OK, back to your discussions with the administration. After Bannon and McMaster and Priebus, who did you talk to next?</strong></em></p>, <p>I saw [Defense Secretary Jim] Mattis three weeks after that first meeting at the White House, and he just fired away with questions \u2015 practical questions \u2015 for an hour. They were questions like: How could the men operate? Under what authority? How would they be accountable? Basically, how would this actually work? He is a historian. He gets it, He was not as quick to discard [my ideas] as many in the Pentagon bubble would be.</p>, <p>But he also pushed back. He said, Why do you say we have to change the rules of engagement [so a viceroy could have greater autonomy]? I showed him pictures of open-air Taliban victory parades in Afghanistan, dozens of captured U.S. vehicles, hundreds of Taliban fighters with their Taliban flag beating their chests, hoorah. They\u2019re winning.</p>, <p>I later heard from multiple people at NSC [the National Security Council] that Secretary Mattis said at a national security Cabinet meeting that I gave the best analysis of the root problems that have to be fixed in Afghanistan of any he\u2019s seen.</p>, <p><em><strong>Who were you picturing as a viceroy? A civilian? A military person?</strong></em></p>, <p>Absolutely not a general. We have enough generals. I was thinking about a guy who had a military and intelligence background in his early career, who spent a long time in business, was very successful at it, and who\u2019s also done something very senior in the intelligence community.</p>, <p>It\u2019s not for everybody because that job will, of course, be vilified. You\u2019re making difficult decisions. He\u2019s going to leave a life of total luxury here and go live in a place where he\u2019s worried about being blown up.</p>, <p><em><strong>Do you know many people like that?</strong></em></p>, <p>I know one.</p>, <p><em><strong>Who?</strong></em></p>, <p>I\u2019ll just say that I floated a name to Steve [Bannon]. He liked it. I took him in and he met him.</p>, <p><em><strong>You took the viceroy candidate to the White House?</strong></em></p>, <p>Yeah, but again, it\u2019s a moot point.</p>, <p><em><strong>Did he meet the president?</strong></em></p>, <p>No, but the president knows him and his wife pretty well. And we\u2019ll have to leave it at that.</p>, <p><em><strong>The weekend before Trump made his Afghan announcement, he went to Camp David with many members of his Cabinet and national security teams. I heard you were supposed to be there, too.</strong></em></p>, <p>I was called by three or four reporters saying they wanted comment because they heard I was supposed to go. That was news to me. We were actually at that time hosting a bunch of wounded veterans at my family\u2019s ranch out in Wyoming.</p>, <p>But I think it was a sliding door moment because my concern is that the only people in that room who challenged the consensus were Attorney General [Jeff] Sessions, who I understand spoke passionately about the need to just leave because it\u2019s a mess, and [Office of Management and Budget director] Mick Mulvaney, who as the budget guy said, \u201cDon\u2019t keep signing up for $50 billion forever.\u201d If there\u2019d been another voice there who could have spoken rationally on a cheaper way to accomplish the mission without having to have a whole bunch of uniform forces to do it, it might have carried the day. If Steve Bannon had not been fired, he would have been the voice.</p>, <p><em><strong>Why do you think the president made the decision he did on Afghanistan?</strong></em></p>, <p>I think it was partly because of the fiasco in Charlottesville and all the media heat from that. I don\u2019t think the president wanted to take any more pounding doing anything different in Afghanistan, so he went with the most establishment-type position. [Republican Sens.] Lindsey Graham and John McCain are praising him for it. That\u2019s pretty much the Beltway establishment.</p>, <p><em><strong>Do you have thoughts on Charlottesville?</strong></em></p>, <p>We\u2019ll narrow the scope of the interview and leave that out of it. I\u2019m not going to give you multiple avenues to attack me. I still remember that recorder\u2019s running.</p>, <p><em><strong>Do you think that Trump will ever change course in Afghanistan?</strong></em></p>, <p>I think the Afghan war has largely been ignored for the last eight years, and now that it\u2019s Mr. Trump\u2019s war, every casualty, every loss of an Afghan base will be reported, and they will hang it around his neck.</p>, <p><em><strong>So the door isn\u2019t closed for you and your ideas?</strong></em></p>, <p>I don\u2019t know. I would say, politically and operationally, the president needs to figure out how to end this thing. It\u2019s his supporters who are doing the fighting and dying. I just saw a study that said that casualties were one of the big issues that swung voters to Trump in districts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. They liked that he was outspoken. \u201cHey, let\u2019s stop the same insanity we\u2019ve been doing.\u201d</p>, <p><em><strong>Did you and Steve Bannon ever talk about using private contractors in areas beyond Afghanistan?</strong></em></p>, <p>I\u2019ve given other suggestions of places.</p>, <p><em><strong>Where did you suggest?</strong></em></p>, <p>That\u2019s for next time. I\u2019ll just say that there are a lot of places [where]\xa0the fires of insurgency have to be put out because these constant failed states export terrorism and refugees. That\u2019s bad.</p>, <p><em><strong>Have you ever met the president?</strong></em></p>, <p>I\u2019ve met him. I certainly met him during the transition. It was at an event; it was not preplanned. But I never met him on this.</p>, <p><em><strong>What are your feelings about his presidency so far?</strong></em></p>, <p>I still have high hopes that as a businessman who has restructured problematic or failing efforts, that he\u2019s still going to come to the right conclusion on this.</p>, <p><em><strong>Let\u2019s move to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/blackwater-founder-held-secret-seychelles-meeting-to-establish-trump-putin-back-channel/2017/04/03/95908a08-1648-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html?utm_term=.510f50b0e736" target="_blank">report in The Washington Post</a> that claimed that the UAE, where your firm is based, set up a meeting in the Seychelles in January between you and someone close to Putin, with the idea that you\u2019d create a \u201cback channel\u201d between the incoming Trump administration and Russia.</strong></em></p>, <p>That was honestly a private business meeting that came about because [a Middle Eastern businessman I was talking to]\xa0said, \u201cHey, there\u2019s this Russian guy you should meet.\u201d I had a beer. I think he had a vodka. It was a quick meeting. I can drink a beer fast.</p>, <p><em><strong>So the allegations of you setting up secret back channels \u2026</strong></em></p>, <p>Zero, totally baseless. The bizarre thing is, it\u2019s connected to the left\u2019s whole fantasy about this Trump-Russia election collusion, right? So I met with some Russian investment manager whose name I don\u2019t remember in January, which is two months after the election. So if this grand conspiracy is true, why the hell would I need to meet with any Russians for any back channel stuff?</p>, <p>And the thing that really bothers me about it is the only reason The Washington Post got the story \u2015 and I have zero doubt about this \u2015 is from signals intelligence that the Obama administration was leaking. [<em>Editor\u2019s note: No proof of this has been reported.</em>]</p>, <p>I don\u2019t want to live in a bureaucratic super state with unlimited surveillance powers. There should be certain rights and privileges a citizen enjoys, and having your private business communications leaked by the security apparatus by a political party for political ends, that is full-stop wrong.</p>, <p><em><strong>Did you write anyone to complain?</strong></em></p>, <p>There are some electrons not worth wasting.</p>, <p><em><strong>You seem very aware of the fact that you became a villain during the Iraq War.</strong></em></p>, <p>Look, in Vietnam, the hard-core anti-war left went after the troops. In Iraq, they went after the contractors. It was politics. Blackwater represented everything they loved to hate and I was the sole owner. I didn\u2019t have a board with a bunch of former generals. I didn\u2019t pay all the Republican Party and the Democratic Party fundraising apparatuses, but it was a business group that executed exactly what the customer needed us to do. We grew and performed. It was actually built on merit, and politics always trumps merit.</p>, <p><em><strong>It seemed as if you disappeared after the war \u2015 at least until the WSJ op-ed.</strong></em></p>, <p>Here\u2019s the thing. In the Obama administration, I stopped trying. There was no point. Now, there\u2019s a chance for a fair hearing.</p>, <p><em><strong>You must enjoy feeling like you\u2019re back in the game.</strong></em></p>, <p>Well, I put everything else on hold to push a different approach in Afghanistan, and it\u2019s been a big goose egg so far.</p>, <p><em><strong>Do you think you\u2019d revive Blackwater domestically?</strong></em></p>, <p>Maybe. I still own the name. But I have no plans to start a U.S. defense contracting business.</p>, <p>Still, I would encourage any objective observer of all the insurgencies going on around the world to ask which one of them has the U.S. actually, directly assisted in ending. Which one?</p>, <p>Let the record show the witness said zero.</p>, <p><em>Language has been adjusted due to a slip of the tongue: Prince meant to say that the hard-core left criticized the troops during the Vietnam War, not World War II.</em></p>, <p><em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/newsletters/must-reads">Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.\xa0</a>Each Sunday, we bring you the best original reporting, long-form writing and breaking news from HuffPost and around the web, plus behind-the-scenes looks at how it\u2019s all made.

Some say they or a relative have been forced to postpone a trip, have temporarily lost power or have been unable to get to work in the past several days.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others say the effects on them or their loved ones have been far more serious.</span></p>, <p>\u201cMom\u2019s house in Rockport was destroyed.

Opinions of Trump\u2019s performance are also positive, with 42 percent approving, 24 percent disapproving and the rest uncertain. (The survey was conducted almost entirely prior to Trump\u2019s visit to Texas on Tuesday, during which he praised the turnout for his event and, </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-hurricane-harvey_us_59a5bdefe4b00795c2a22e0c?q1e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to pool reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, made little mention of the victims of the storm.)</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps unsurprisingly, Americans\u2019 ratings of Trump\u2019s performance were far more polarized than their opinions about the federal government overall. Among those polled who were asked about the federal government\u2019s response, voters who supported the president in last year\u2019s election were 35 points likelier than those who supported Hillary Clinton to approve. Among those asked specifically about Trump, the gap in approval between Trump and Clinton voters was twice as big.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brock Long, Trump\u2019s pick to run the Federal Emergency Management Agency,\xa0has decades of experience in emergency management and\xa0</span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brock-long-fema-hurricane-harvey_us_59a5593be4b0446b3b865a39"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has been hailed by a former FEMA official</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as \u201cprobably one of the best prepared (people) that the country could ask for.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cFEMA is going to be [in Texas] for years,\u201d Long said Sunday in an interview with CNN. \u201cThis disaster is going to be a landmark event. ...

In a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-tax-reform_us_59a6c4e6e4b063ae34da49a4" target="_blank">speech in Springfield, Missouri</a>, on Wednesday, Trump framed his plan to dramatically lower corporate and individual tax rates as a coup for ordinary Americans, whose pay has stagnated in the past four decades.</p>, <p>In fact, the evidence suggests that Trump\u2019s tax cuts would line corporate CEOs\u2019 pockets, while depleting the Treasury and doing little, if anything, to boost working class Americans\u2019 bottom line.</p>, <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s plan would double down on the anti-populist features of the current system,\u201d said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the progressive <a href="https://itep.org/" target="_blank">Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy</a>.</p>, <p>Here are some ideas Trump could get behind if he is really interested in championing working people.</p>, <p>Trump and congressional Republicans argue that corporations are hoarding money overseas, and otherwise choosing not to invest in the U.S. economy, because the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent is higher than most other countries.</p>, <p>But large corporations, adept at accounting gimmicks, pay a lot less than the official top rate.</p>, <p>U.S. corporations paid a <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/actual-us-corporate-tax-rates-are-in-line-with-comparable-countries" target="_blank">tax rate of 24 percent</a> on profits from new investments in 2014, compared with 21 percent for other G-7 countries, according to the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/" target="_blank">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, a liberal think tank. When it comes to taxes paid on global profits, from 2006 to 2009, U.S. multinational corporations actually paid a slightly lower rate than their competitors in other G-7 nations, the Center on Budget found.</p>, <p>And many of the big-name firms now insisting that lower taxes would spur investment and job creation have a record of failing to do so despite the relatively low effective rates they already enjoy.\xa0<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/opinion/corporate-tax-cuts-jobs.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">AT&amp;T</a>, for instance, is one of the 92 profitable, publicly owned corporations with effective tax burdens of 20 percent or less where median employment actually went down 1 percent from 2008 to 2016, compared with 6 percent growth in the private sector as a whole, <a href="http://www.ips-dc.org/report-corporate-tax-cuts-boost-ceo-pay-not-jobs/" target="_blank">according to a report</a>\xa0that the Institute for Policy Studies released on Wednesday.</p>, <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a long history, at both the national and state levels, of business leaders asking for tax breaks and just seeing what they can get,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cAll too often, these companies have been rewarded simply for asking.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Just as Trump and his Republican allies have misdiagnosed the problem, their proposed solutions would fail to solve it and create new shortcomings in the process. Trump originally proposed to lower the top corporate rate to 15 percent; he is reportedly now amenable to a rate between <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/us/politics/trump-missouri-tax-plan.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">20 and 25 percent</a>.</p>, <p>Absent foolproof enforcement, however, corporations could still seek lower tax locales to stash their on-paper profits. That\u2019s because even now, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/biggest-corporations-hiding-over-trillion-overseas_us_57100f97e4b0060ccda2c625" target="_blank">companies such as Apple</a> are merely pretending to make their profits overseas through tricks like registering their highly valuable intellectual property in tax havens. If a company is able to shop for the lowest-tax nation, nothing the U.S. can lower it to can beat countries like <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-corporate-tax-rates.pdf">Bermuda</a>, where the corporate tax rate is zero, Gardner noted.</p>, <p>Instead, Gardner and Sarah Anderson, lead author of the IPS report on low-tax U.S. corporations\u2019 recent job creation history, favor ending the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-current-system-international-taxation-work" target="_blank">loophole that allows corporations to defer U.S. taxes</a> indefinitely on profits that are technically held overseas until they are repatriated to the United States. Under their plan, all corporate profits around the world would be subject to U.S. taxes, minus the foreign taxes a company has already paid on a particular profit pool.</p>, <p>Shutting down a major incentive for companies to offshore their earnings would pave the way for corporations to shoulder a larger share of the national tax burden. But on its own, it would not guarantee additional investment from corporations. Corporate profits <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wall-street-short-term-economy_us_563d1e5ce4b0411d3071229f" target="_blank">have soared</a> since the 1980s even as corporate investment has declined.</p>, <p>To incentivize the kind of corporate investment that increases productivity and employment, Trump could enact regulations aimed at reforming corporate governance that would discourage corporations from paying out the lion\u2019s share of their profits as dividends and stock buybacks.</p>, <p>\u201cOur system is really set up to reward short-term performance\u201d rather than long-term investment, Anderson said.</p>, <p>One of the most direct ways to help struggling Americans is to literally give them more money.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, major cuts in income tax rates, by their very nature, disproportionately benefit the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-tax-cut_us_58f14cbce4b0da2ff860eaff" target="_blank">wealthiest 20 percent of earners</a> who pay a majority of the country\u2019s income taxes. The lower 80 percent of Americans are already paying less in federal taxes than they have in decades.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s tax proposals would cost the federal government $3.5 trillion over a 10-year period, according to the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cutting-taxes-and-making-future-americans-pay-for-it.pdf" target="_blank">nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>.</p>, <p>Assuming that the president intends to stick by his previous suggestions that the tax cuts would not add to annual budget deficits, he would have to cut an equivalent amount from government spending, necessitating cuts to key social programs like <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/medicaid" target="_blank">Medicaid</a> that Americans with lower earnings depend on.</p>, <p>As a result, the bottom four-fifths of American earners would see <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/vast-majority-of-americans-would-likely-lose-from-trump-tax-cuts-once-theyre#_ftn1" target="_blank">a net drop in their incomes</a> under Trump\u2019s tax plan, according to an analysis by the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that used the president\u2019s budget proposal as a model for the spending cuts he favors.</p>, <p>Even Alan Viard, a fellow at the conservative <a href="http://www.aei.org/" target="_blank">American Enterprise Institute</a>, who favors tax cuts in principle, suggested that the benefits of Trump\u2019s plan for ordinary workers could hinge on how he chooses to finance the tax cuts.</p>, <p>\u201cOne of the unanswered questions here is how are the goodies \u2015 lower corporate tax rates and cuts for the middle class \u2015 going to be paid for?\u201d said Viard, expressing skepticism with Trump\u2019s suggestion that they can be paid for by closing tax loopholes that \u201cprimarily benefit\u201d the rich.</p>, <p>One option for Trump to assist the struggling working class, as he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/donald-trump-why-americans-support" target="_blank">claimed</a> he would <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2016/11/18/donald-trump-white-working-class-voters-election-2016-519095.html" target="_blank">during his campaign</a>, would be to dramatically increase the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/earned-income-tax-credit" target="_blank">Earned Income Tax Credit</a>, an annual check the government cuts to working, lower- income families. Former President Gerald Ford established the EITC, which was increased by his fellow Republican successors, and it was designed as a way to lift the fortunes of the poor and, by making benefits dependent on employment, encourage impoverished people to work.\xa0</p>, <p>Chuck Marr, who directs the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\u2019 tax policy program, is the chief architect of a plan that would expand EITC eligibility to cover childless workers and roughly double its benefit from the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/eitc-income-limits-maximum-credit-amounts-next-year" target="_blank">current maximum of $3,400</a> for a family with one child. He sees it as a proposal that Trump should find naturally appealing, given his campaign\u2019s professed focus on lifting up the working class.</p>, <p>Congressional Democrats led by Rep. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/ro-khanna" target="_blank">Ro Khanna</a> (D-Calif.) plan to introduce legislation that would enact a similar plan in the near future. Khanna estimates the proposal would <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/ro-khanna-trillion-dollar-plan/524754/">cost $1 trillion</a> \u2015 less than one-third of Trump\u2019s proposed tax cuts.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, earners in the top income tax bracket only pay a </span><a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-are-capital-gains-taxed" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20-percent tax rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on investment dividends and capital gains \u2015 or income obtained from the sale of a financial asset \u2015 that they have held for longer than a year. By contrast, those same earners pay a </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/2017-tax-brackets/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">39.6 percent tax rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on all ordinary income above $418,400.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 2013, the top 1 percent of earners owned </span><a href="http://www.marineconomicconsulting.com/w20733.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">39 percent of the stock market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to an analysis by New York University economist Edward Wolff \u2015 making the wealthiest sliver of Americans the primary beneficiaries of the lower tax rate on capital gains.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt would be hard to develop a tax break more geared to the 1 percent than the capital gains tax break,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIf you wanted a populist reform, you\u2019d start by getting rid of the capital gains tax break.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative economists argue that raising the capital gains tax rate would discourage investment in the economy. But numerous </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-correlation-capital-gains-taxes-gdp-2012-11" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other</span></a> <a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/capital-gains-lets-rumble/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including billionaire investor </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/opinion/buffett-a-minimum-tax-for-the-wealthy.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren Buffett</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have found no evidence of a correlation between capital gains tax rates and economic growth.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Trump is going in the opposite direction of increasing taxes on capital gains. His original tax plan included a provision cutting taxes on pass-through income, or business income that \u201cpasses through\u201d to the individual owners, to no more than 15 percent, rather than the highest individual income tax rate of 39.6 percent. The change would primarily benefit hedge funds and other elite financial firms that use \u201cpass-through\u201d accounting \u2015 including the president\u2019s real estate company, the Trump Organization. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Center on Budget estimated that 69 percent of this specific tax cut would go to families with annual incomes </span><a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/trump-tax-plans-pass-through-tax-break-would-provide-massive-windfall-to-the" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over $1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Levying a modest tax on individual financial transactions has gotten more attention in developed nations since the\xa0<a href="https://www.thebalance.com/what-caused-2008-global-financial-crisis-3306176" target="_blank">global financial crisis</a>\xa0of 2007-2008.

Dean Baker, a co-director of the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research, projected in a </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/reining-in-wall-street-to-benefit-all-americans/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 2016 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that a 0.2 percent tax on stock trades, and slightly lower taxes on bond and derivatives trades, would raise $120 billion in revenue per year.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIf you wanna talk about helping Pennsylvania and Ohio at the expense of Wall Street, it is hard to do better than the financial transactions tax,\u201d Baker said.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revenue from such a tax unlocks funding for major social programs that benefit middle- and working-class people.

And she is outraged about Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender troops. She clearly saw the president making an attack on her brothers and sisters who served alongside her, a vicious assault on men and women in the military. And she just had to speak out.</p>, <p>Detlefsen, on July 26, posted a National Public Radio article about the ban to her account, and then commented: \u201cThis man is a disgrace.

As the city scrambles to fix its broken water pumps for the remnants of Hurricane Harvey, engineers are working with the Dutch government on a longer-term, environmentally friendly plan to let the water in and make New Orleans look more like Amsterdam.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t simply address the hard infrastructure issues,\u201d like drain pumps and levees, said Justin Ehrenwerth, president and chief executive of The Water Institute of the Gulf, an independent research group. \u201cWe have to look at green infrastructure and develop better practices of living with water.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Last month, The Water Institute, which is supporting Louisiana\u2019s $50 billion coastal protection plan,\xa0joined forces with a Dutch research company,\xa0Deltares of the Netherlands, to develop nature-based solutions to New Orleans\u2019 water problems. Dutch designers have been collaborating with New Orleans engineers and architects since 2006, but the work grows more urgent each year as climate change exacerbates the storms and coastal erosion that threaten to sink New Orleans. If the city can learn to embrace and store the water in productive ways, as Dutch cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam have done with their canal systems, flooding will cease to be as much of a threat.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThere are already bayous that go through the city,\u201d Ehrenwerth said. \u201cThe question is how can we enhance them. There is a commitment by the New Orleans city leadership to move forward with that line of thinking, which unfortunately becomes more necessary the more we see these storms.\u201d</p>, <p>New Orleans has already begun to experiment with green infrastructure in the <a href="https://www.nola.gov/resilience/resources/grd-fact-sheet-20170130/" target="_blank">Gentilly Resilience District</a>,\xa0a racially diverse, middle-class area of the city that has become the poster child for innovative water plans. As part of the project, which is funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and received $141 million from the National Disaster Resilience Competition, a former convent was converted into a \u201cwater garden\u201d and recreation space that can store up to 10 billion gallons of stormwater. And the medians, or neutral grounds,\xa0of major streets in the area have been redesigned to store water.</p>, <p>\u201cIn Amsterdam, you don\u2019t want to walk on a dry street; you want to walk on a wet street,\u201d David Waggonner, an urban and environmental architect working on the city\u2019s water strategy, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/why-doesnt-new-orleans-look-like-amsterdam/402322/" target="_blank">told The Atlantic</a>.\xa0\u201cIn New Orleans, we\u2019ve hidden and squandered the asset.\u201d</p>, <p>New Orleans officials are very much in favor of investments in green infrastructure. City Councilman Jason Williams told HuffPost on Monday that he would like to see the city paved with a permeable material, instead of concrete,\xa0and have Dutch-style canals and ditches.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cIf you fight with water in a riptide,\xa0you are going to lose,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo we have to learn to live with it, to give it a place to go other than into your house or car.\u201d</p>, <p>Houston should also be taking notes from the Netherlands. The city is only 40 miles from the Gulf Coast and 50 feet above sea level, making it <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houston-flood-history-reason_us_59a2f0e3e4b05710aa5ce9ad">extremely prone to floods</a>\xa0like the one happening now. More people have died from flooding in Houston than in any other locality in the country since 1960, <a href="http://www.tamug.edu/CTBS/" target="_blank">according to a report by Texas A&amp;M University</a>\xa0\u2015 and a large part of the problem is the city\u2019s massive sprawl of concrete.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cHouston has basically just grown outwards,\u201d Andrew Dessler, a climatologist and professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&amp;M, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houston-flood-history-reason_us_59a2f0e3e4b05710aa5ce9ad">told HuffPost on Sunday</a>. \u201cAs Houston grows out, you\u2019re paving over more and more space and you\u2019re collecting rain over a larger area that\u2019s just hitting cement. It\u2019s got to go somewhere, so it gets concentrated where the elevation is low.\u201d</p>, <p>As global warming magnifies these storms and raises sea levels, cities like New Orleans and Houston have no choice but to adapt and learn, despite the climate change skeptic in the Oval Office and his administration.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of sitting around and debating these issues,\u201d said Ehrenwerth. \u201cWe just have to live with it every day. It\u2019s an issue of life or death.\u201d\xa0</p>]

So Was The Hurricane.</h1>|[<p>WASHINGTON \u2015 Jackie Griggs knew a baby was coming. On Saturday, the certified nurse-midwife drove about 12 miles from her home to the Bay Area Birth Center in Pasadena, a suburb near Houston. The day before, the storm didn\u2019t seem like that big of a deal. Then Hurricane Harvey hit. Griggs, who is 59, called three other people, but they couldn\u2019t make it in. She realized that she was going to be delivering the baby alone.</p>, <p>Holly Wood, 24, and her husband, John, had already driven in from their home more than an hour away in Lumberton. With the hurricane approaching, they decided to come early and stay at a hotel down the street. Wood had the option to go to a hospital, but she felt comfortable with Griggs.</p>, <p>\u201cAll I needed was her and my husband, and that big old bathtub,\u201d she said, noting that she did not have a complicated pregnancy, with the exception of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/severe-morning-sickness--known-as-hg--can-leave-women-starving/2017/03/10/2ebbdaa4-ecad-11e6-9662-6eedf1627882_story.html?utm_term=.a4eb1c40ab95" target="_blank">hyperemesis gravidarum, or HG</a>, which causes severe nausea and vomiting.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The birth center was on pretty high ground. But shortly after Wood and her husband arrived on Saturday, the streets started to flood. The couple and the midwife buckled in for a long night. As Wood labored, the rain pounded down, and lightning and thunder rocked the building. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI kept going to the doors, seeing if water was coming in, looking to see if there was any trees down,\u201d Griggs said. The building was secure, but she looked outside and saw water running over the sidewalks and the street. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griggs, who has five sons, and has delivered about 1,200 babies, had been through a major storm before \u2015 nine years ago, when Hurricane Ike hit. Back then, the center lost electricity. This time, she was more prepared with flashlights and candles, and was grateful when the power stayed on. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cMe and the baby\u2019s dad looked at each other a few times after lightning, like, \u2018Oh my gosh!\u2019\u201d Griggs said. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt got to be where all I could focus on was how much pain I was in,\u201d Wood said, of giving birth. But there were a few times the storm got scary. When they were wondering whether the power was going to go out, she reassured herself that women have been delivering babies for a long time. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her healthy baby, Atlas, was born Sunday morning, weighing 9 pounds, 3 ounces. The new parents couldn\u2019t leave right away because of the water. John ventured alone to the hotel on Sunday, to make sure the route was safe. Holly was scared, praying that he wouldn\u2019t get stuck. They finally made it to the Quality Inn, driving past cars abandoned in the storm. </span></p>, <p>Griggs, the nurse-midwife, tried to go home, but turned her car around after she saw high water. \u201cThe sights were shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cThe flooding was incredible.\u201d She holed up in the birth center, eating instant oatmeal and raisins, and reading <em>The Liar\u2019s Club</em>, a memoir about an east Texas oil town.</p>, <p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of lonesome,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cBut I\u2019m just thankful to be OK.\u201d As of Tuesday, she was planning to bring diapers to a nearby church shelter and help out with kids there.</p>, <p>Wood, the new mom, previously worked as a grooming assistant, and her husband is employed at a restaurant and farmer\u2019s market in Beaumont. They have big plans for Atlas. They hope to take him traveling as soon as he\u2019s a little bigger.</p>, <p>\u201cWe really want to experience the world,\u201d she said.</p>, <p>But for now, they\u2019re waiting out the storm, hoping the supplies they packed \u2015 fortunately, \u201cI usually am a little bit of an overpacker,\u201d Wood said \u2015 will last. To pass time, they\u2019re renting movies from a nearby Redbox, watching \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and \u201cGoing in Style.\u201d</p>, <p>Wood\u2019s milk production hasn\u2019t started yet, but she has donated milk with her. Because the stores are closed, they were unable to buy a dropper for the baby. So, they fashioned a makeshift one in the hotel room out of a plastic cup and a coffee straw.</p>, <p>\u201cYou adapt to what you got to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of learned how to work with what you\u2019re given.\u201d</p>, <p><em><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/newsletters/must-reads">Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.\xa0</a>Each Sunday, we will bring you the best original reporting, long form writing and breaking news from The Huffington Post and around the web, plus behind-the-scenes looks at how it\u2019s all made.

She ran to the sunroom that faces her backyard and discovered water already 5 inches deep. Out front, a brown river sloshed from the street to her doorstep. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She roused her three young sons and began frantically moving rugs, photo albums and electronics to dry surfaces. At 7:30 a.m., she called 911. But hours later, no one came. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThey were backed up pretty badly,\u201d Plushnick-Masti, 42, a communications director at the Houston Forensic Science Center, told HuffPost by phone later that evening. \u201cBut by about 10, it was clear that it was going to be catastrophic.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She began posting on Facebook and texting friends, and found out her local rabbi was sending a boat around to pick up stranded people in need of rescue. The family of five threw laptops, cellphones, chargers, a few pairs of pants and some T-shirts into garbage bags and waited, perched on the kitchen counter, water lapping just inches below. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the motorboat arrived to pick them up, the water was so high it overturned the family\u2019s washing machine and stand-up freezer. Plushnick-Masti, who is about 5 feet tall, had to swim to reach rescuers. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt was cold, it was nasty, it was brown,\u201d Plushnick-Masti said from a makeshift shelter a church, where the electricity was out. \u201cThe water was so powerful.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurricane Harvey, the strongest storm to make landfall in the United States in nearly a decade, brought on Plushnick-Masti\u2019s fourth flood since moving to Houston in 2010 \u2015 and the second one that\u2019s caused damage to her home. But it\u2019s the first time she\u2019s been forced to flee by boat. She lives in Meyerland, southwest of the city\u2019s center. The neighborhood is predominantly middle class, and roughly two-thirds of the population is white, according to census </span><a href="http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/Demographics/docs_pdfs/SN/sn_coh_race_ethn.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p>Meyerland has experienced flooding in the past few years, but it usually is spared the worst of the damage. Heavy rains often wreak havoc on neighborhoods on Houston\u2019s east side, though, where many low-income African-Americans and Latinos live.</p>, <p>The city has made upgrades to Meyerland\u2019s flood infrastructure in recent years, Plushnick-Masti said. She had flood insurance as part of her mortgage.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s different when this happens in areas with some money and influence,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are seeing some improvement to bayou and flood plains, but they can\u2019t keep up with these storms.\u201c</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houston\u2019s growth in recent decades has made it the country\u2019s fourth-largest city, but its urban planning regulations are still rooted in the Wild West days. The city expanded outward, turning lands that once absorbed rainwater into parking lots, roads and developments. There are\xa0</span>no environmental zoning laws, only deeds that allow property owners to dictate how the land is used. In wealthier \u2015 which, in a city where Jim Crow once reigned, usually translates to whiter \u2015 areas, residents invited flood safeguards, such as dikes and berms, and spurned hazards such as chemical plants and refineries.</p>, <p>\u201cNo one has ever really seemed to care very much because those people don\u2019t have much political clout or voice,\u201d Paul Hart, a historian at Texas State University who grew up in Houston, told HuffPost. \u201cOver the last 15 years or so, as the city has exploded in growth and they paved the wetlands, those middle-class white and upper middle-class areas, like Meyerland and Bellaire, those are even beginning to flood.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchester, an east side neighborhood where nearly 90 percent of the population is Hispanic, set a record on Sunday with </span><a href="https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/mammoth-flood-disaster-houston-more-rain-yet-come"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 9 feet of water</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many of the residents there are now among the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-harvey-texas-shelter-katy-evacuation_us_59a4d003e4b041393a2025ae?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009">estimated 30,000</a> in need of shelters.\xa0Renters and low-income people in such neighborhoods couldn\u2019t afford the luxury of telling Exxon Mobil Corp. to keep its </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/08/13/exxon-mobil-is-still-pumping-toxins-into-black-community-in-texas-17-years-after-civil-rights-complaint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily polluting operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> away from their homes and schools.

It\u2019s difficult to pinpoint the role of climate change in creating a storm as destructive as Harvey, but violent, less predictable weather is expected to become more frequent as the planet warms.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That bodes ill for Houston.

Congress returns to work on Sept. 5. Lawmakers will then have less than a month to meet several crucial deadlines affecting whether the federal government will actually be able to help out.\xa0</p>, <p>The big deadline is Sept. 30.\xa0Congress needs to pass legislation to keep the government funded beyond that date. Otherwise, it will shut down. That day is also when the National Flood Insurance Program\u2019s authorization expires.</p>, <p>When the government shuts down, federal workers are divided into two categories: essential and non-essential. Those in the former category are allowed to continue working, while people in the second are furloughed until the government reopens.\xa0</p>, <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency would continue to lead rescue operations for Harvey in the case of a shutdown, with many of its employees fitting into the essential category. But that doesn\u2019t mean FEMA won\u2019t be affected.\xa0</p>, <p>Daniel Watson was the spokesman for FEMA in 2013, the last time the government shut down. At the time, the agency was <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/with-u-s-government-shut-down-colorado-has-to-tap-into-its-own-money-to-rebuild-73dd9bd006f/" target="_blank">helping Colorado recover from massive floods</a>. Watson said the agency\u2019s response work was not impacted, but FEMA did have to devote resources to dealing with the shutdown, rather than focusing all its attention on disaster relief.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThe biggest impact was FEMA needing to take all these additional steps that you don\u2019t usually have to do \u2015 identifying, \u2018Oh, does this person need to be here or not,\u2019 rather than just doing the job,\u201d Watson said.\xa0</p>, <p>The bigger issue with FEMA is what happens with its Disaster Relief Fund, which could soon run out of money unless Congress appropriates more.\xa0FEMA gives out two types of assistance: public (which goes to governments) and individual (checks directly to individuals to cover damages). All that money comes from the Disaster Relief Fund.\xa0</p>, <p>According to <a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1502382921399-0c5cb3af822a83ef9ead6369c64f22e9/REVISED-July2017DisasterReliefFundReport.pdf" target="_blank">FEMA\u2019s most recent report</a>, issued in early August, the fund will have between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion at the end of September. That likely will not be nearly enough for Harvey.</p>, <p>As a comparison, about a month after Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast, FEMA had already <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2012/12/05/written-testimony-fema-administrator-senate-appropriations-subcommittee-homeland" target="_blank">sent out around $1.9 billion</a>.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cIn the event of a government shutdown, FEMA will continue to support survivors and communities affected by Hurricane Harvey,\u201d agency spokeswoman Justine Whelan told HuffPost. \u201cFEMA makes payments for Individual Assistance and Public Assistance, until funds are no longer available in the Disaster Relief Fund.\u201d</p>, <p>FEMA also operates the National Flood Insurance Program, which is already <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/cost-of-cleaning-up-harvey-will-bring-new-test-of-governance-for-trump-and-gop/2017/08/27/9ce55456-8b95-11e7-84c0-02cc069f2c37_story.html?utm_term=.690a7aa40eef" target="_blank">more than $24 billion in debt</a>. If it expires Sept. 30, <a href="http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-south-pinellas/st-petersburg/homeowners-worry-as-national-flood-insurance-program-set-to-end" target="_blank">millions of homeowners may be without coverage</a>. The program has a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/cost-of-cleaning-up-harvey-will-bring-new-test-of-governance-for-trump-and-gop/2017/08/27/9ce55456-8b95-11e7-84c0-02cc069f2c37_story.html?utm_term=.690a7aa40eef" target="_blank">$30 billion borrowing limit</a>, and with massive new claims coming in from Harvey, congressional action will be needed to raise the ceiling. (Congress did the same thing after Hurricane Katrina.) In Houston alone, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-28/how-harvey-squeezes-congress-on-flood-insurance-quicktake-q-a" target="_blank">more than 1 million people</a> have federal flood insurance coverage.\xa0</p>, <p>Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/congress-flood-insurance/535731/" target="_blank">say they want to reform the program</a>\xa0\u2015 it pays out far more than it collects in premiums \u2015 but there isn\u2019t much time to figure something out before the next reauthorization.</p>, <p>\u201cDetails are still being worked through, but the flood insurance program will be reauthorized,\u201d said AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).\xa0</p>, <p>A senior Democratic aide, who requested anonymity to speak openly, said he was less certain that reauthorization would happen, predicting that a short-term extension was more likely either on its own, or as part of a continuing resolution to keep the government open \u2015 in part because Republicans aren\u2019t unified on what to do.\xa0</p>, <p>A big sticking point is what to do about the flood insurance program\u2019s billions in debt. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has proposed legislation forgiving the debt, arguing that it\u2019s unlikely to be repaid unless the program ends up being actuarially sound and starts making money. In other words, Congress would need to change the structure of the program.</p>, <p>\u201cThe current level of debt is <a href="https://democrats-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=399985" target="_blank">wholly unsustainable</a>,\u201d Waters said in a statement last year. \u201cNot only is the NFIP spending billions of dollars just to pay off this debt, but it is increasing fees on policyholders that are already struggling with rising premiums. Congress must forgive this debt so that we can begin to approach broader reauthorization efforts with a clean slate and provide residents in flood-prone areas with a stable, affordable program in the wake of unexpected disasters.\u201d</p>, <p>Finally, there\u2019s the issue of emergency aid legislation allocating money to help people affected by Harvey. These measures used to be easy and noncontroversial, but not any longer. The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-harvey-texas-republicans-sandy-hypocrisy_us_59a46fcce4b041393a1fc43a">big questions</a>\xa0now are whether the funding will be offset by cuts to other government programs, and whether unrelated items will be attached to the legislation.\xa0</p>, <p>Texas Republicans are in a tough spot, likely wanting as much aid for their constituents as possible \u2015 but also having to justify the fact that the vast majority of them <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-harvey-texas-republicans-sandy-hypocrisy_us_59a46fcce4b041393a1fc43a">opposed emergency aid</a> after Hurricane Sandy.</p>, <p>Democrats have said they would not go along with any Republican attempts to offset Harvey relief funding.</p>, <p>\u201cRepublicans must be ready to join Democrats in passing a timely relief bill that makes all necessary resources available through emergency spending,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement. \u201cWith the National Flood Insurance Program expiring at the end of September, House Republicans must also move swiftly to ensure that affordable flood insurance continues to be available to communities across our country.\u201d</p>, <p>A final potential stumbling block could be President <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>. The president has threatened to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-shutdown-wall_us_59a49648e4b050afa90c3b98">block government funding legislation</a> and shut down the government if he doesn\u2019t get Congress to approve funding for his border wall \u2015 which he continues to insist Mexico will eventually pay for anyway.\xa0</p>, <p><strong><em>Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

Greg Abbott by telephone on Sunday evening to offer his country\u2019s support. The Republican governor\xa0<a href="https://twitter.com/megwagner/status/902249693069025280" target="_blank">told</a> reporters on Monday that his staff would communicate with Mexican government officials about specific needs.\xa0</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cOur offering is open and permanent,\u201d Carlos Sada, Mexico\u2019s undersecretary for North America, told HuffPost on Monday evening. The Mexican government is waiting for Abbott to send a list specifying both the immediate and long-term needs of hurricane victims in Texas, Sada said.\xa0</span></p>, <p>The Mexican government made a formal assistance offer to the State Department on Tuesday, a State Department spokeswoman told HuffPost. The department will decide with FEMA whether to accept the aid, said the spokeswoman, who declined to specify the type of assistance Mexico is offering.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mexican government has proved willing and able to provide crucial help to Americans in the wake of previous natural disasters. In September 2005, days after Hurricane Katrina wiped out cities along the Gulf Coast, soldiers from the Mexican army rolled across the border in a 45-vehicle convoy and set up camp at a former Air Force base near San Antonio. Over the next three weeks, the Mexican soldiers served 170,000 meals to hurricane victims, distributed 184,000 tons of supplies, and conducted more than 500 medical consultations, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/when-mexicans-crossed-our-border-to-feed-our-hungry/2015/08/28/347342e4-4cee-11e5-84df-923b3ef1a64b_story.html?utm_term=.ef3e9f4adb49"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recalled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stephen Kelly, a former diplomat who was serving at the U.S. embassy in Mexico City at the time.

Texas law enforcement agencies</span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/28/us/harvey-good-samaritans-cajun-navy-trnd/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tweeted requests for volunteers with boats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assist in rescue operations. FEMA has already mobilized all 28 of its urban search and rescue teams, a step it has not been taken since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Jeffrey Stern, state coordinator at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management </span><a href="https://twitter.com/SternJD"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the midst of a natural disaster, the U.S. government can be slow to accept foreign assistance because of the bureaucratic hassle involved in clearing materials brought into the country and securing access for foreigners on short notice, said Kelly. But he advised the current administration to take advantage of the offer from its southern neighbor \u2015 both because of Mexico\u2019s close proximity to Texas and because of the symbolic message that cooperation between the two countries would send. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump, who announced his candidacy for president with a speech that described Mexicans as \u201crapists,\u201d has strained the historically close relationship between the U.S. and Mexico. On Sunday, as Hurricane Harvey raged through Texas, Trump tweeted that Mexico </span><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/901802524981817344"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will pay for a wall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its northern border, that the country has </span><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/901802524981817344"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high crime rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and that he might \u201cterminate\u201d a free-trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada because the U.S. allies are \u201c</span><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/901804388649500672"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being very difficult</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mexican Foreign Ministry responded by stating that it will not pay for the wall, that crime is a shared problem between the two countries, and that it will not renegotiate NAFTA \u201cthrough social networks or the media.\u201d The statement ended with an offer to help the U.S. government respond to the storm, \u201cas good neighbors should always do in times of difficulty.\u201d </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Souder, a 22-year-old student at the University of Houston whose car was flooded, said he was frustrated with the president for tweeting about the border wall as the hurricane spread through Texas. \u201cMexico sent their own people to help during Katrina and you want to tweet this Shit right now?\u201d Souder\xa0</span><a href="https://twitter.com/xSouder/status/902267176790446081"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Trump on Sunday. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cI feel like we do need foreign aid,\u201d Souder told HuffPost on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re completely underwater.\u201d</span></p>, <p><em>Teresa Villa of HuffPost M\xe9xico contributed reporting.\xa0</em></p>, <p><em>This article has been updated to include Mexico\u2019s formal offer of assistance.</em></p>]

Bruce Rauner (R) signed a law Monday authorizing different state agencies to automatically register voters when they interact with them, marking a huge victory for voting advocates after Rauner vetoed similar legislation a year ago. </span></p>, <p>Illinois is the 10th state to adopt automatic voter registration, a process by which people are automatically registered to vote or have their information updated on the rolls when they interact with the state\u2019s motor vehicle agency or some other state agencies. Oregon was the first state to adapt automatic voter registration in 2015, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/automatic-voter-registration_us_593a97d7e4b0c5a35c9e9d7a" target="_blank">advocates say</a>\xa0the reform can significantly strengthen voting rights.</p>, <p>While it\u2019s too early to assess the overall impact of automatic voter registration, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/vermont-automatic-voter-registration_us_59970776e4b0e8cc855d58e8" target="_blank">early indications</a>\xa0suggest that it could significantly bolster voter participation.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Illinois, Rauner\u2019s signature is particularly significant not only because he is a Republican \u2015 most of the places that have adopted automatic voter registration are heavily Democratic \u2015 but because he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-bruce-rauner-veto-automatic-voter-registration-met-0813-20160812-story.html" target="_blank">vetoed</a>\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatic voter legislation in August of 2016. At the time, he said it would open the door to voter fraud.</span></p>, <p>After the state\u2019s legislature failing to override his veto, voting advocates brought up the measure again this year. They tweaked the language making it so that voters had to affirm they were eligible to vote when they registered and giving them the option to opt-out at the time of a transaction with the state agency. The new law also allows the state to verify voter rolls using data collected from state agencies participating in automatic voter registration, something that will significantly improve accuracy, according to Abe Scarr, the director of Illinois PIRG, which was a member of the Just Democracy coalition that pushed for automatic voter registration.</p>, <p>The retooled legislation passed both chambers of the Illinois legislature unanimously.</p>, <p>Advocates appealed to legislators by emphasizing the ways the new law would save money and improve the accuracy and security of voter rolls, Scarr said.</p>, <p>\u201cWe kind of came in thinking the efficiency and saving taxpayer dollars would be a real big selling point and it was fine, but it was often the accuracy and security message that worked both with Republican legislators and more broadly with the public,\u201d he said.\xa0</p>, <p>Andy Kang, legal director of the Chicago chapter of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, another member of the coalition, said Republicans and immigrants were able to find common ground on concerns over election security.</p>, <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see accidental voter registration to ineligible folks, either. There are very severe immigration consequences,\u201d Kang said. \u201cWe were very careful and put in a lot of thought about addressing how this automatic process would work to make accidental [registration] much less likely, to have cleaner lists of eligible voters and have a more accurate system long term.\u201d</p>, <p>\u201cI think when we were able to find that common ground there, we had that same concern, same goal \u2015 maybe we\u2019re coming at it a little bit differently \u2015 that was something we could think about when talking to Republicans,\u201d he added.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scarr said advocates also accepted a request from Rauner\u2019s office to include the Department of Natural Resources and Department of Financial and Professional Regulation to be agencies that offered automatic voter registration. </span></p>, <p>\u201cThis was never stated, but they\u2019re more symbolically Republican agencies, you know, hunters, fishers, small business people,\u201d Scarr said.</p>, <p>For voting rights advocates, who want registration in as many state agencies as possible, it was easy to accept.\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Rauner\u2019s office said in May he intended to decide on the legislation, he had been largely silent on it since then. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander (D), who is now leading a voter advocacy group called Let America Vote, had\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.sj-r.com/opinion/20170815/guest-column-land-of-lincoln-can-become-leader-in-democracy" target="_blank">penned an op-ed</a>\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier in August speculating that Rauner might veto the legislation to prevent new voters from getting registered in hopes of boosting his election chances next year.</span></p>, <p>But Rauner\u2019s signature on Monday will immediately allow Illinois election officials to begin to develop guidelines for implementing the law.</p>, <p>Automatic voter registration at motor vehicle agencies will start on July 1, 2018, and a year later at other state agencies.</p>, <p>\u201cPassing a law is not the end of a campaign, it\u2019s an opportunity and so it\u2019s very important to us that we stay engaged with the implementing agencies which are numerous,\u201d Scarr said. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited and proud of where we\u2019ve gotten to but it\u2019s not done until the law goes into effect and has the outcomes that we\u2019ve promised and advocated for the last two years.\u201d</p>]

The government created the hashtag #EsHoraDeDefenderLaPatria, which translates as \u201cIt\u2019s Time To Defend The Homeland,\u201d to promote the exercises.</p>, <p>TV images showed Venezuelans young and old entering military reserve registration centers. But there was no evidence that registration reached far beyond government employees and Maduro\u2019s Socialist Party loyalists.</p>, <p>Scenes were aired of camouflaged sharp-shooters firing their weapons while military commanders gave fiery speeches at \u201canti-imperialist\u201d rallies. More exercises were scheduled for Sunday.</p>, <p>Opposition figure and former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles sent a tweet dismissing the weekend training program as an expensive farce. He said Maduro should focus instead on bringing down Venezuela\u2019s high crime rate.</p>, <p>Diplomatic tensions increased last month when a legislative superbody called the constituent assembly was elected at Maduro\u2019s behest. It has the power to legislate, bypassing the opposition-controlled congress.</p>, <p>Maduro says the new assembly is Venezuela\u2019s only hope of restoring peace after months of deadly anti-government protests.</p>, <p>Leaders of the fractious opposition coalition boycotted the July 30 election of the assembly, branding it an affront to democracy. They called for an early presidential election, which Maduro would likely lose as his popularity sinks along with an economy blighted by triple-digit inflation and food shortages.</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s threat of military action played into Maduro\u2019s hands by supporting his oft-repeated assertion that the U.S. \u201cempire\u201d has been waging economic war on Venezuela and wants to invade the country to steal its vast oil reserves.</p>, <p>The idea had been laughed off as absurd by opposition and U.S. officials before Trump said on Aug. 11 that \u201ca military option is certainly something we could pursue\u201d as a way of ending Venezuela\u2019s crisis.</p>, <p>\xa0</p>, <p><em>(Reporting by Hugh Bronstein; Additional reporting by Deisy Buitrago and Johnny Carvajal; Editing by Andrew Hay and Paul Simao)</em></p>]

The La Quinta Inn in Victoria, where she works as a general manager, was fully booked with people who had evacuated from towns along the coast.\xa0</p>, <p>But once the guests were gone, Hallam \u2015 along with some other staff members and the hotel\u2019s owner, Jitan Patel \u2015 decided to stay put.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWe were thinking, \u2018When this thing is over, this hotel is going to be needed,\u2019\u201d Hallam told HuffPost. \u201cWe can give people beds.\u201d</p>, <p>While a sign on the front door warned that the area had been evacuated, about 70 people \u2015 plus a collection of pets including dogs, cats and at least one rabbit \u2015 were hunkered down at the inn Saturday afternoon, waiting out Hurricane Harvey as it lingered over the region.\xa0\xa0</p>, <p>Those who stayed had faced a rough night Friday, as Harvey made landfall. Wind speeds measured at over 100 miles a hour knocked down electric poles, blew out several of the hotel\u2019s windows and sent a sign from the McDonald\u2019s across the street spinning down the pavement, kicking up sparks as it went.</p>, <p>One wall of a tower atop the beige, four-story hotel was completely ripped off as of Saturday, and some of the surrounding wood was charred. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to the tower, but we could hear it,\u201d Hallam said. \u201cIt sounded like someone drove a truck into the building.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>Inside, the 70-some people, including members of Hallam\u2019s family, were still waiting for the worst of Harvey to pass. They\u2019d lost power overnight, but a generator allowed them to keep their phones charged and a portable gas stove in the kitchen allowed them to cook. \xa0</p>, <p>Around Victoria, debris was scattered and power lines sagged. While the hurricane\u2019s winds had started to die down, reducing it to a tropical storm as of Saturday afternoon, the rain continued to fall and the threat of flooding remained. Forecasts for the area called for 20 or more inches of rain, presenting a high risk of catastrophic flooding, according to the National Hurricane Center.\xa0</p>, <p>Shane Castillo and his fianc\xe9e, Cristina Narajano, were among the people gathered at the hotel Saturday.</p>, <p>The couple had been living on the streets for the last six months, after Castillo lost a job in construction right before an emergency back operation. Their luck had finally changed three days ago, when they moved into a five-room house that they were helping the landlord refurbish.\xa0</p>, <p>But the storm winds knocked a big tree onto the house, tearing open the roof, Castillo told HuffPost. They stayed as the rain poured inside until around 6:30 a.m., when dawn began to break. Then they set out on foot looking for shelter.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWe were just coming out here and by God\u2019s grace these people let us in,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this hotel, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019d be right now.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>They said they were uncertain what they would do once the storm passed and the flood waters receded. \u201cIt was hard enough finding help in the first place,\u201d Narajano said, referring to the couple\u2019s previous housing struggles. \u201cNow, everyone\u2019s going to need help.\u201d\xa0\xa0\xa0</p>, <p>Hallam\u2019s father, Morris Maretick, who had come inland from his farm to ride out the storm, wasn\u2019t sure whether his house was still standing. The 60-year-old said he tried to check on it Saturday, but couldn\u2019t pass through a series of downed electric poles.\xa0</p>, <p>Hallam said she\u2019d already heard that one of her employees lost her home: \u201cThe apartment is gone, but she\u2019s safe so far.\u201d</p>, <p>Trees and power lines were down across many of the roadways in Victoria, making some of them impassable. Windows were boarded up or taped over, and gas stations, stores and restaurants remained closed. Yet a number of vehicles were driving around.\xa0The Texas National Guard was out assessing the damage here.</p>, <p>There was no widespread flooding, but some low-lying streets were already under water, with more rain expected to continue overnight.\xa0</p>]

He also pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who had been found in contempt of court for violating a judge\u2019s order stemming from a racial profiling case. Notwithstanding Hurricane Harvey, Trump\u2019s pardon of Arpaio spurred fierce criticism, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-trump-arpaio_us_59a17023e4b05710aa5c7fdc" target="_blank">including from Sen.

Wall Street banks <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/15/on-this-day-8-years-ago-lehman-brothers-collapsed-have-we-learned-anything.html" target="_blank">were collapsing</a>. Everywhere,\xa0<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/15/real_estate/millions_in_foreclosure/" target="_blank">people were losing their homes</a> to foreclosure. The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2009/jan/wk2/art02.htm" target="_blank">unemployment rate</a> was spiking. The Bush administration, hobbled by the Iraq War and the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, was desperate to put together an economic relief bill that could, for the moment, stop the bleeding. Congress was loath to trust then-President George W. Bush and bail out Wall Street \u2015 especially on the eve of a presidential election. </span></p>, <p>All of this came to a head in early September 2008, when the House of Representatives was set to vote on a\xa0$700 billion relief bill.</p>, <p>This week\u2019s episode of HuffPost\u2019s \u201cCandidate Confessional\u201d podcast is about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/29/AR2008092900623.html" target="_blank">that fateful, failed vote</a>, which sent the stock market plummeting and embarrassed both the White House and Congress. It is told through a joint interview with two key House staffers who witnessed it all: Michael Steel, who was the press secretary for then-Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio), and Brendan Daly, the communications director for then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cThis is another shit sandwich that we\u2019re going to have to eat on behalf of the administration,\u201d Steel said, describing how the House GOP caucus felt when the bill was first introduced. \u201cBoehner referred to it explicitly in those terms. And it was absolutely clear that this was going to be a totally politically toxic vote.\u201d</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Convincing reluctant members to vote for a $700 billion bailout of banks that figured prominently in the economic collapse was always going to be a tricky endeavor. But things took a turn for the bizarre when Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) suspended his presidential campaign to come to Washington, as Steel described it, to try and look busy. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cIt was bizarre,\u201d Steel said. \u201cHe\u2019s a candidate, so he couldn\u2019t just go to his Senate office, so he comes to Boehner\u2019s office and basically spends several hours hanging out in the minority offices on the House side of the Capitol. At this point, various members are coming in to talk to him about the crisis and what they think ought to be done, but there wasn\u2019t like a vetting process or a procedure, so it was sort of any member with the gumption or the thought that maybe I contribute something to the situation.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of being informed, McCain looked to be out of his depths. He barely spoke when a bipartisan group of leaders met to discuss matters in the White House. At that point, it had become clear that Republican factions were rebelling against the idea of giving the Bush administration more money. But Democrats were, of course, skeptical of anything Bush touched, too. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cEven though everyone agreed that we needed to do something, we weren\u2019t just going to give a blank check,\u201d Daly explained.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite misgivings within both parties, there was an understanding among leadership that each side would bring enough votes, so that the bill would pass, since the alternative \u2015 failure \u2015 was unthinkable. But when the legislation reached the floor, the numbers just didn\u2019t materialize. Republicans blamed a speech from Pelosi that cast blame on them for getting into this mess.

Many sides,\u201d Harris said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SenatorKamalaHarris/posts/531032550573216" target="_blank">Facebook post on Sunday</a>. \u201cI often advocate that we look at many sides of an issue, walk in someone else\u2019s shoes and identify and reject false choices.

My thoughts on Charlottesville. <a href="https://t.co/wR8DxyTljG">https://t.co/wR8DxyTljG</a> <a href="https://t.co/Rrgw1pNv3B">pic.twitter.com/Rrgw1pNv3B</a></p>, <p>Harris went on to describe moments in history where rhetoric similar to Trump\u2019s kept schools and restaurants segregated.</p>, <p>\u201c\u2018Many sides\u2019 suggests that there is no right side or wrong side, that all are morally equal. But I reject that,\u201d Harris wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to spot the wrong side here. They\u2019re the ones with the torches and the swastikas.\u201d</p>, <p>The White House attempted to clarify the president\u2019s remarks on Sunday morning, but those comments didn\u2019t come from Trump.</p>, <p>\u201cThe president said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred. Of course, that includes white supremacists, KKK, Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups. He called for national unity and bringing all Americans together,\u201d the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-supremacy-charlottesville_us_598f9931e4b08a247274e406">statement</a>, attributed to a spokesperson, read.</p>, <p>Trump\u2019s seeming inability to directly condemn the violence perpetuated by white supremacists in Virginia has resulted in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-house-response-charlottesville_us_59908c5ce4b090964297cdf5?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009">widespread outrage</a> across the country. His unwillingness to disavow white supremacy is also at odds with a growing number of officials, including <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-house-response-charlottesville_us_59908c5ce4b090964297cdf5?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009">members of the Trump administration</a>, who have spoken out against the hateful acts.</p>, <p>But Harris remains optimistic.</p>, <p>\u201cThere is hope to be found.

Negotiation Experts Say Otherwise.</h1>|[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON \u2015 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> is the best at making deals. The best! He\u2019ll tell you himself by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/535551178520924160"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeting</span></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/449225960630792193"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unsolicited</span></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/659720759695151104"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how to win in a negotiation or bragging about his book\xa0</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Art of the Deal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which </span><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he didn\u2019t actually write</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but whatever).</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we can see for ourselves how the president puts his deal-making skills to work. Last week, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/australia-mexico-transcripts/?utm_term=.994521e45979"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post released transcripts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of two phone calls Trump had with foreign leaders in January \u2014 one with Mexican President Enrique Pe\xf1a Nieto and another with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. It\u2019s a rare window into how Trump works his magic with people one-on-one when he doesn\u2019t think anyone is watching.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were no deals made on either call. Trump threatened Pe\xf1a Nieto, a top U.S. ally, with tariffs on Mexican goods and then warned he\u2019d never meet with him unless he stopped saying publicly that Mexico won\u2019t pay for Trump\u2019s promised border wall. In a heated exchange with Turnbull, also a key U.S. ally, Trump vented about the \u201cstupid deal\u201d the United States had made with Australia to accept refugees into the country. He all but hung up on Turnbull in the end.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this as bananas as it sounds? Or maybe Trump is deploying clever, art-of-the-deal tactics that casual observers might miss? </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We asked experts in business and diplomatic negotiation to weigh in.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cHis skills are few,\u201d John Oesch, an associate professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, said in an email. \u201cHe has relied on power (or perceived power), threats, and treating people very poorly to get what he wants. Most negotiation scholars agree that power is an unsustainable way to resolve conflict and a poor negotiating technique, unless you want only to take from the other party and not create any value for either side.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony Wanis-St. John, an associate professor at the School of International Service at American University, said Trump\u2019s approach was \u201cvery transactional,\u201d a style that may have served him well in commercial real estate but will flop in international relations.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cHe\u2019s treating Pe\xf1a Nieto as if he were a merchant and he were a souvenir purchaser haggling for a price,\u201d said Wanis-St. John. \u201cThis is ill-suited for complex policy decisions that require much more persuasion and problem solving. It makes Trump look a little venal, a little weak. Not like the president of a great power.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some saw a deeper level of negotiation taking place, even in a constructive way. Daniel Shapiro, an associate professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of the Harvard International Negotiation Program, said if you look past each leader\u2019s stated position and consider his underlying interests, there\u2019s a lot of overlap.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the border wall, for example, Trump and Pe\xf1a Nieto disagreed on everything about it, but both worried about losing credibility if they budged in their positions. As for accepting refugees from Australia, Trump worried about looking foolish for taking them in after imposing his travel ban, and Turnbull didn\u2019t want to be strong-armed into breaking a U.S.-Australia agreement. The common denominator, says Shapiro, is saving face.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cNobody wants to feel taken. Effective negotiators recognize that once we understand each other\u2019s underlying interests, we can truly invent options for mutual gain,\u201d said Shapiro, who wrote the book </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negotiating the Nonnegotiable: How to Resolve Your Most Emotionally Charged Conflicts</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. \u201cThese leaders behind closed doors need to feel comfortable sharing information with one another so they can start figuring out options that address each of their constituency\u2019s interests.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There\u2019s no question, though, that Trump\u2019s default is bullying people to get his way. One of the first stories he tells in</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Art of the Deal</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is about a call he made to a bank executive to try to help an older woman, Mrs. Hill, whose farm was facing foreclosure. Her husband had killed himself in the hopes his life insurance would save the farm, but it turned out it wasn\u2019t enough. The bank executive told Trump the bank was moving ahead with auctioning off the farm, and there was nothing he could do about it.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cThat really got me going,\u201d Trump writes. \u201cI said to the guy, \u2018You listen to me. If you do foreclose, I\u2019ll personally bring a lawsuit for murder against you and your bank, on the grounds that you harassed Mrs. Hill\u2019s husband to death.\u2019 All of a sudden the bank officer sounded very nervous and said he\u2019d get right back to me. Sometimes it pays to be a little wild.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His belligerent approach to negotiating is an example of what experts call distributive bargaining \u2014 making outrageous demands and hoping the other side gives ground in a zero-sum situation, says Fen Osler Hampson, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Canada. The problem with applying this tactic to something like, say, threatening tariffs on Mexican imports is that it would damage the U.S. economy, too, by driving up prices of products.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cAs we\u2019ve heard from American companies who do business across the border, it\u2019s going to hurt U.S. jobs. You don\u2019t negotiate by shooting yourself in your own foot,\u201d said Hampson. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty weak weapon. Choose your weapons carefully.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those with firsthand experience in international diplomacy, a stunning detail from the president\u2019s calls was that his team didn\u2019t appear to bring him up to speed on the issues relevant to the world leaders he was talking to. For example, Trump told Pe\xf1a Nieto that he could help him fight organized crime by sending the U.S. military into Mexico.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cAnyone who knows anything about the U.S.-Mexico relationship knows that the idea of U.S. troops on Mexican soil is a no-no,\u201d said Arturo Sarukh\xe1n, who served as the Mexican ambassador to the U.S. from 2007 to 2013. \u201cSo no one briefed the president and said, \u2018This is the type of stuff you can say, this is no-go territory?\u2019 That\u2019s troubling.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked how he would respond to Trump\u2019s push for a border wall if he were still the Mexican ambassador, Sarukh\xe1n said he would never challenge how the United States wants to handle its security matters. But he would make it clear to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/trump-administration/">Trump administration</a> that a wall would tank relations with Mexico.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cAll the issues in Trump\u2019s campaign \u2015 the qualifications of Mexicans as rapists and \u2018bad hombres\u2019 and the wall \u2015 have poisoned the well of public perception of the U.S. in Mexico,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where I think Trump has had a more detrimental effect on the U.S.-Mexico relationship. He has turned the clock back on how citizens on both sides need to understand they are co-stakeholders.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, have walls ever really been effective? Even the former Mexican ambassador knows the White Walkers will eventually clear that 700-foot wall of icy magic in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and try to wipe out the human race.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cOh, they\u2019re going to get past it. We can see that coming,\u201d Sarukh\xe1n predicted. \u201cI\u2019d love to see Daenerys and Jon Snow slugging it out with dragons and dragon glass.\u201d</span></p>]

At the start of his remarks, for example, Schumer praised his assembled colleagues for \u201cputting American workers first.\u201d</p>, <p>He later dubbed China \u201crapacious\u201d for helping its corporations and investors gobble up American companies even as it failed to reciprocate by letting in American products like Hollywood films.</p>, <p>Schumer\u2019s vow to put \u201cAmerican workers first\u201d arguably echoed Trump\u2019s promise to put \u201c<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/20/politics/trump-inaugural-address/index.html" target="_blank">America First</a>\u201d in his inaugural address.\xa0</p>, <p>At the press conference, the senators made overtures to Republicans to collaborate on various pieces of legislation, including a bill Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) <a href="https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases/made-in-america-water-infrastructure-act">introduced in March</a> that would require American-made steel and iron to be used in drinking water infrastructure projects.</p>, <p>\u201cWe need Republicans to stand with us, and with our manufacturers and with American workers,\u201d Baldwin said.</p>, <p>Even Baldwin\u2019s reference to her own \u201cBuy America\u201d bill, however, was an opportunity to call out Republicans for failing to uphold President Trump\u2019s promises to pursue trade policies aimed at helping American workers. Trump said in April that he <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/donald-trump-in-wisconsin-i-support-tammy-baldwin-buy-america/article_b67c1da4-2062-51a6-aacb-f39d4bbc9595.html">supported Baldwin\u2019s legislation</a>.</p>, <p>Yet House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/329504-trump-expresses-support-for-democratic-buy-america-bill">stripped similar language</a> out of a water bill last year, a development Baldwin attributed to the fact that \u201cforeign steel companies bought Washington lobbyists to kill it.\u201d (At the time, Ryan argued that the provision could unduly obstruct companies from getting federal contracts.)</p>, <p>\u201cCongressional Republican leadership continues to stand in the way.

As part of the lawsuit, the ACLU is requesting a Kansas federal judge unseal documents that Kobach was photographed holding when he met with Trump in November 2016, as well as a draft amendment to federal voting law, which circulated in his office. The documents contain potential amendments to the National Voter Registration Act, a 1993 law requiring motor vehicle and some other state agencies to provide opportunities to register to vote.</p>, <p>The public release of the documents would be significant because Kobach is the de facto leader of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a probe Trump convened in May to investigate election confidence. Trump and Kobach <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud-commission-first-meeting_us_596fc4f3e4b0aa14ea76dcd8">have promised a neutral investigation</a>, but critics say the panel is an effort to substantiate Trump\u2019s claims of widespread voter fraud and lay the groundwork for restrictive voting laws. Documents that show Kobach attempting to change federal law to impose more restrictive voting policies could substantially undermine the perception of impartiality.</p>, <p>A separate <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-nvra_us_59698037e4b017418627ac98">email made public</a> as part of the lawsuit revealed Kobach was already working on an attempt to amend NVRA the day after Trump was elected.</p>, <p>In the filing, Kobach, who is also running for governor of Kansas for 2018, seemed aware that releasing the documents would impact his work on the commission.</p>, <p>\u201cIt would undermine Secretary Kobach\u2019s interest in fulfilling his appointed duty\xa0<span style="font-weight: 400;">and responsibilities on the Presidential Election Commission which include being able to advise\xa0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the President privately on matters within the purview of the Commission,\u201d Kobach and his lawyer wrote. \u201cThe public broadcast of the Secretary\u2019s documents related to these meetings with the President would hinder his ability to confidently advise the President.\u201d</span></p>, <p>ACLU lawyers sought the documents because they say an attempt to amend NVRA would be a concession by Kobach that federal law, as written, does not allow the state to impose a proof of citizenship requirement. Kobach initially refused to turn over the documents to ACLU lawyers, saying they were irrelevant, but only did so after a U.S. magistrate judge forced him to do so.\xa0Those documents are currently under a protective seal from the court and not available to the public.</p>, <p>The magistrate judge also sanctioned Kobach <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-donald-trump_us_594d72f0e4b05c37bb766e6e">with a $1,000 fine</a><strong>\xa0</strong>last month for misleading the court about the contents of the documents. In denying Kobach\u2019s appeal of the sanctions, U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson noted Kobach <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/judge-says-kobach-has-shown-pattern-of-misleading-court/2017/07/25/166ff512-7181-11e7-8c17-533c52b2f014_story.html?utm_term=.1f39f99f39ec" target="_blank">had a pattern</a> of misleading statements before the court.</p>, <p>Beyond hindering his work on the commission, Kobach said in the Friday filing the documents were irrelevant to the central claims in the lawsuit and the ACLU only wanted them to be made public because the group wanted to fundraise off of them. Kobach also said the documents were protected by<strong>\xa0</strong>Kansas state law and disclosing would make it more difficult for him to give candid advice on sensitive matters in the future.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its own filing earlier this month, ACLU lawyers said Kobach had no basis for keeping the documents shielded from public view and the \u201cpublic has a presumptive right of access to judicial records and a well-recognized interest in understanding disputes presented in federal litigation, particularly those regarding matters of paramount public concern, such as access to the franchise.\u201d</span></p>]

They remain behind bars only because they can\u2019t afford to pay the bail Cantrell has set, according to the complaint.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cantrell routinely refuses to set bail below $2,500, regardless of the facts of a case or a defendant\u2019s ability to pay, the suit claims. In most cases, the judge forces defendants to seek the services of a commercial bail bondsman, which in Orleans Parish charge a non-refundable 12-percent or 13-percent fee on the total bond amount.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe don\u2019t go any lower than $2,500 in this court,\u201d Cantrell told one defendant\u2019s attorney. \u201cThis court never goes any lower than $2,500,\u201d he said in another case. \u201cI don\u2019t got any lower than $2,500 on my bonds,\u201d he said in yet another. In one instance, he told a lawyer he was going to set bond at $2,500, regardless of what information the lawyer provided.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit provides examples of Cantrell threatening to hold defense attorneys in contempt of court for asking that their clients be released on their own recognizance, rather than on financial conditions. In one case, Cantrell pushes back against an attorney\u2019s request by warning that he\u2019ll revoke a previous release order for another of the attorney\u2019s clients.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cDefense counsel is placed in the impossible position of having to weigh her own personal freedom against her obligation to advocate for her client\u2019s constitutional right to a meaningful bail hearing,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cThe threat of jail time in retaliation for an attorney\u2019s basic oral advocacy would have a chilling effect on even the most zealous advocate and constitutes a gross abuse of authority.\u201d</span></p>, <p>Cantrell, the father-in-law of mayoral candidate and New Orleans City Councilwoman Latoya Cantrell, owed the federal government more than <a href="http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2014/08/court_finds_orleans_judge_cant.html" target="_blank">$600,000 in back taxes</a> as of 2014. <a href="http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2012/10/new_orleans_lawyer_cited_for_m.html" target="_blank">His son, Jason, was suspended</a>\xa0as a city attorney in New Orleans after a marijuana joint fell out of his pocket in court.\xa0Jason Cantrell later <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/is-latoya-cantrell-new-orleans-next-mayor-117064_Page2.html#.WVLgChMrJE4" target="_blank">resigned from the job.</a></p>, <p>Cantrell also ran a <a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/08/new_orleans_judge_running_dang.html" target="_blank">complex for elderly and disabled people</a>\xa0that had more than two dozen federal violations and was <a href="https://www.hudoig.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016-FW-1004.pdf" target="_blank">deemed \u201cdangerous\u201d by Department of Housing and Urban Development officials.</a></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Orleans Parish Criminal District Court collects $1 million each year on fees assessed on bonds defendants pay through commercial bail bond companies, according to the suit. That money helps pay for salaries and benefits for court employees, travel to official events, office supplies, building maintenance, legal research and other day-to-day expenses.</span></p>, <p>\u201cThe infrastructure of [Cantrell\u2019s] court \u2014 from the salary of his staff to the paper in his printer \u2014 depends upon the continued generation of money from for-profit commercial surety fees, which are entirely dependent on his judicial decisions,\u201d the suit reads.</p>, <p>\u201cIn short, he\u2019s helping balance the court budget on the backs of those least able to afford it and most likely to fall further into debt because they are kept locked in jail,\u201d said Eric Foley, an attorney with the MacArthur Justice Center office in New Orleans.</p>, <p>In 2015, 97 percent of Orleans Criminal District Court defendants who were assessed a financial bail obtained their freedom through a commercial surety, according to the complaint. The suit alleges that the practices violate the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s locking up people for being poor, plain and simple,\u201d <a href="http://neworleans.macarthurjusticecenter.org/uploads/rsmjc-neworleans/documents/2017.06.27_cantrell_lawsuit_news_release_final.pdf" target="_blank">said</a> Katie Schwartzmann, co-director of the MacArthur Justice Center.</p>, <p>The lawsuit is the latest in a string of suits filed by groups like Civil Rights Corps that challenge what advocates call \u201cwealth-based bail practices.\u201d One of Civil Rights Corps\u2019 lawsuits was\xa0<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-american-bail-industry_us_57b727bde4b03d513687f5e8">supported</a>\xa0by the Obama Justice Department last year.

I worry deeply about the lives that are gonna be adversely affected by changes in policy.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>The program will focus on many aspects of gender equity, including reproductive rights, ending gender-based violence, equal pay and paid family leave. But Jarrett and Tchen are particularly concerned about the GOP push to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-obamacare-repeal_us_593723f2e4b0ce1e7408aebf" target="_blank">repeal</a> the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/affordable-care-act" target="_blank">Affordable Care Act</a>, Obama\u2019s signature health care law, which prevented insurance companies from charging women more just for being women. The law popularly known as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/obamacare" target="_blank">Obamacare</a> also required employers to cover the full range of preventative services for women \u2015 such as contraception, well-woman visits and breast examinations\u2015 in their insurance plans with no copay.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cWe are now seeing the lowest rates of unplanned pregnancy in our country, so the idea that we\u2019re going to lose all of that in the Republican plan is unthinkable,\u201d Tchen said.\xa0</p>, <p>The first summit is due to take place\xa0<a href="https://www.theunitedstateofwomen.org/galvanizechicago/" target="_blank">in Chicago</a> in July, where Jarrett, Tchen and a diverse group of women\u2019s rights activists and state politicians will give local women the tools to be effective leaders in a political movement. Speakers include Illinois Democratic State Sens. Toi Hutchinson and Juliana Stratton, and Jennifer Welch, CEO of Planned Parenthood Illinois. Chicago is a symbolic place for the tour to begin, not only because it\u2019s the hometown of Obama and Jarrett.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cChicago is home to a vibrant community of activists, especially people who have worked on gender equality issues, and it\u2019s center of the country,\u201d Tchen said. \u201cIt speaks to Middle America and to the values we want to see across the country. It was a really natural starting place.\u201d\xa0</p>, <p>The program will host similar summits in Columbus,\xa0Atlanta,\xa0Miami, Albuquerque, and Philadelphia.\xa0</p>, <p>While Tchen and Jarrett are frustrated to see certain setbacks for women under Trump, they still believe the Obama administration permanently advanced the cause of equity by showing women what equitable health care and a feminist president looks like. Now, women are motivated to fight for rights like insurance coverage of contraception because they saved\xa0$1.4 billion on copays in the first year the benefit was in place.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cChanging attitudes is a lot of what we did,\u201d Tchen said, \u201cand that\u2019s going to outlast any attempt to undo the policy.\u201d</p>]

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>, <p>Kushner\u2019s attorney, Jamie Gorelick, said Kushner did not remember any calls with Kislyak between April and November.</p>, <p>\u201cMr. Kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period. He has no recollection of the calls as described. We have asked [Reuters] for the dates of such alleged calls so we may look into it and respond, but we have not received such information,\u201d she said.</p>, <p>In March, the White House said that Kushner and Flynn<span class="highlight"> had </span>met Kislyak at<span class="highlight"> Trump </span>Tower in December to establish \u201ca line of communication.\u201d Kislyak also attended a<span class="highlight"> Trump </span>campaign speech in Washington in April 2016 that Kushner attended. The White House did not acknowledge any other<span class="highlight">contacts </span>between Kushner and<span class="highlight"> Russian </span>officials.</p>, <p>Before the election, Kislyak\u2019s<span class="highlight"> undisclosed </span>discussions with Kushner and Flynn focused on fighting terrorism and improving U.S.-<span class="highlight">Russian </span>economic relations, six of the<span class="highlight"> sources </span>said. Former President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia after it seized Crimea and started supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014.</p>, <p>After the Nov. 8 election, Kushner and Flynn also discussed with Kislyak the idea of creating a back channel between<span class="highlight"> Trump </span>and<span class="highlight"> Russian </span>President Vladimir Putin that could have bypassed diplomats and intelligence agencies, two of the<span class="highlight"> sources </span>said.\xa0Reuters was unable to determine how those discussions were conducted or exactly when they took place.</p>, <p>Reuters was first to report last week that a proposal for a back channel was discussed between Flynn and Kislyak as<span class="highlight"> Trump </span>prepared to take office. The Washington Post was first to report on Friday that Kushner participated in that conversation.</p>, <p>Separately, there were at least 18<span class="highlight"> undisclosed </span>calls and emails between<span class="highlight"> Trump </span>associates and Kremlin-linked people in the seven months before the Nov. 8 presidential election, including six calls with Kislyak,<span class="highlight"> sources </span>told Reuters earlier this month. . Two people familiar with those 18<span class="highlight"> contacts </span>said Flynn and Kushner were among the<span class="highlight"> Trump </span>associates who spoke to the ambassador by telephone. Reuters previously reported only Flynn\u2019s involvement in those discussions.</p>, <p>Six of the<span class="highlight"> sources </span>said there were multiple<span class="highlight"> contacts </span>between Kushner and Kislyak but declined to give details beyond the two phone calls between April and November and the post-election conversation about setting up a back channel. It is also not clear whether Kushner engaged with Kislyak on his own or with other<span class="highlight"> Trump </span>aides.</p>, <p>FBI scrutiny of Kushner began when intelligence reports of Flynn\u2019s<span class="highlight"> contacts </span>with<span class="highlight"> Russian</span>s included mentions of U.S. citizens, whose names were redacted because of U.S. privacy laws. This prompted investigators to ask U.S. intelligence agencies to reveal the names of the Americans, the current U.S. law enforcement official said.</p>, <p>Kushner\u2019s was one of the names that was revealed, the official said, prompting a closer look at the president\u2019s son-in-law\u2019s dealings with Kislyak and other<span class="highlight"> Russian</span>s.</p>, <p>FBI investigators are examining whether<span class="highlight"> Russian</span>s suggested to Kushner or other<span class="highlight"> Trump </span>aides that relaxing economic sanctions would allow<span class="highlight"> Russian </span>banks to offer financing to people with ties to<span class="highlight"> Trump</span>, said the current U.S. law enforcement official.</p>, <p>The head of<span class="highlight"> Russian </span>state-owned Vnesheconombank, Sergei Nikolaevich Gorkov, a trained intelligence officer whom Putin appointed, met Kushner at<span class="highlight"> Trump </span>Tower in December.

Benefits vary by state but average about $125 a month per recipient.\xa0</p>, <p>Perdue\u2019s comments came in response to questions from Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), who said afterward he felt reassured. \u201cI think it was a pretty full-throated, strong defense of SNAP and I was encouraged to hear it,\u201d McGovern told HuffPost. \u201cThis guy could be an ally.\u201d</p>, <p>Perdue also said he didn\u2019t like the sound of banning unhealthy foods like soda and candy from what food stamp recipients are allowed to purchase. Currently benefits can be used for any food product in a grocery store except alcoholic beverages or hot meals prepared at the point of purchase. The idea of restricting benefits to healthier food is generally popular, and Republicans have proposed doing so several times.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cI probably lean more to the laissez faire than the proscriptive in that area,\u201d Perdue said, calling it a dicey issue in light of the U.S. obesity epidemic.\xa0</p>, <p>Republicans in the recent past have sought to cut SNAP through the budget process but <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/10/gop-food-stamps_n_7554336.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=HUFFPOST%20HILL%20051517&amp;utm_content=HUFFPOST%20HILL%20051517+CID_109db1111380d5a75c0b48277a180371&amp;utm_source=Email%20marketing%20software&amp;utm_term=declined%20to%20do%20so&amp;ncid=newsltushpmgnewsHUFFPOST%20HILL%20051517">haven\u2019t had any luck</a>, as the agriculture committees in the House and Senate have defended their prerogative to set SNAP policy every five years as part of a farm legislation. The committees are planning to pass a new farm bill next year.\xa0</p>, <p>On Wednesday, HuffPost asked House agriculture committee chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) if there was any chance the budget committee could force cost reductions in SNAP for the next fiscal year.

Some State Department officials reportedly expressed surprise at the move because of the White House\u2019s ongoing efforts to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-100-days-environment-earth-day_us_58f87b68e4b0cb086d7e3175" target="_blank">roll back environmental protections</a>.</p>, <p class="p1">Tillerson signed the pledge, called the <a href="https://www.state.gov/e/oes/rls/other/2017/270802.htm" target="_blank">Fairbanks Declaration</a>, Wednesday night during the 10th meeting of the Arctic Council, a network of eight nations with territory in the region, including Russia, Canada and the Nordic countries. The <a href="https://www.state.gov/e/oes/rls/other/2017/270802.htm" target="_blank">document</a> specifically urges the ratifying bodies to \u201cnote with concern the widespread impact of climate change on the Arctic\u201d and calls for the implementation of the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/paris-climate-agreement/" target="_blank">Paris climate agreement</a>.</p>, <p class="p1">Tillerson\u2019s signature <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-arctic-summit-idUSKBN1870FT" target="_blank">took some State Department officials aback</a> because he\u2019s yet to give any indication as to whether the U.S. will stay in the Paris pact,\xa0Reuters news agency reported, citing an anonymous source at the department.</p>, <p class="p1">\u201cWe\u2019d heard ... that there would likely be a significant U.S. effort to redline or even remove entirely the Paris and climate language,\u201d the source said.</p>, <p class="p1">The New York Times in March reported the Trump administration was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/us/politics/climate-change-trump.html" target="_blank">split on the Paris agreement</a>, with Tillerson and White House adviser <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/ivanka-trump" target="_blank">Ivanka Trump</a> urging for the U.S. to stay in. White House Chief Strategist <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/topic/steve-bannon" target="_blank">Stephen Bannon</a> was among those pressing the president to withdraw. The White House has <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/white-house-postpones-climate-change-meeting/" target="_blank">postponed meetings on climate change twice</a> in recent months, and Tillerson gave no hint this week about whether the United States would continue to abide by the terms of the accord.</p>, <p class="p1">At the close of the council\u2019s meeting Thursday, Tillerson said the U.S. would \u201ccontinue to be vigilant in protecting the fragile environment in the Arctic\u201d and the White House was \u201ccurrently reviewing several important policies, including how the Trump administration will approach the issue of climate change.\u201d</p>, <p class="p1">\u201cWe\u2019re appreciative that each of you has an important point of view and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns,\u201d he said, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-arctic-council-20170511-story.html" target="_blank">according to the Los Angeles Times</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to rush to make a decision.

This has included <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-budget_us_58ca12a7e4b0ec9d29d8a9ad" target="_blank">a proposed slash in funding</a> at the Environmental Protection Agency and calls to increase <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/business/coal-jobs-trump-appalachia.html" target="_blank">domestic protection of coal and oil</a>.</p>, <p class="p1">The declaration pointed to such activities, and said signatories recognized \u201cthat activities taking place outside the Arctic region, including activities occurring in Arctic States, are the main contributors to climate change effects and pollution in the Arctic, and underlining the need for action at all levels.\u201d</p>, <p class="p1">The Arctic has become a bellwether region for the impacts of climate change.

The resolution, which now moves to the Senate for consideration, targets Department of Labor rules designed to expand the number of working Americans with access to IRA-styled savings accounts.</p>, <p>Created last August, these rules had paved the way for California Secure Choice, the state-managed individual retirement account program that is on track to provide retirement nest eggs for nearly seven million Californians whose employers don\u2019t offer pensions or 401(k) plans. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-retirement-program-20160929-snap-story.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Signed into law </a>by Jerry Brown only last September, it isn\u2019t scheduled to begin enrollment until 2019.</p>, <p>The August rule changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) clarified ERISA\u2019s broad preemption for state laws that cover private-sector employee pension benefit plans. The changes, according to <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/default/files/ebsa/temporary-postings/savings-arrangements-final-rule.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the DOL</a>, were intended to fill gaps in the nation\u2019s employer-provided retirement savings system that has left nearly 39 million private-sector workers \u2014 some say the number is as <a href="http://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/info-2017/congress-takes-aim-at-state-retirement-plans-ea.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">high as 55 million</a> \u2014 without a job-provided retirement plan. The DOL also noted that less than 10 percent of all workers contribute to a plan outside of work.</p>, <p>But <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/66" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HJR 66</a> and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/67" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HJR 67</a>, joint resolutions introduced earlier this month by Republican Representatives Tim Walberg (MI) and Francis Rooney (FL), put the new federal rules that allow such state-sponsored plans on <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/house-gop-poised-undo-obama-midnight-regulations" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a kill list</a> of regulations that govern the Affordable Care Act, environmental safety and consumer protection through the rarely used <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43992.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Congressional Review Act</a>.</p>, <p>The resolutions were both prompted and cheered by the <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/letter/coalition-letter-supporting-cra-action-state-sponsored-auto-iras" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a> and the <a href="http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2016/08/08/lobbyists-urge-california-governor-to-block-state-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mutual funds industry</a>, which had strenuously opposed Secure Choice because of longstanding industry concerns that state-sponsored programs could compete with their own products.</p>, <p>\u201cThis is not new for the large financial institutions and insurance companies,\u201d Secure Choice oversight board member Yvonne Walker told <a href="http://capitalandmain.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Capital &amp; Main</a>. \u201cThey have a long history of fighting against state efforts to expand retirement savings options for everyday workers. They say, \u2018Oh, well we don\u2019t want to be in competition with the states.\u2019 But the reality is there are multiple retirement savings plans on the market, and the truth of it is that overall, working people can\u2019t afford to purchase retirement savings plans on their own.\u201d</p>, <p>The passage of HJR 66 and 67 unfolded against a 35-year backdrop of stagnant wages and the dismantling of the traditional employer-sponsored, private-sector retirement savings pillar in the U.S. \u2014 the defined-benefit pension plan \u2014 that has left nearly half of all Americans with nothing saved for retirement. At the same time, critics have <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-gop-retirement-savings-attack-20170210-story.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that the IRA industry has never seen much profit in marketing retirement plans to the low-wage workers and small-workforce businesses that Secure Choice would most benefit.</p>, <p>\u201cIn California there is a brewing retirement crisis where you have our large aging population and, at the same time, we\u2019ve got the first baby-boom generation going into retirement,\u201d explained Nari Rhee, the Retirement Security Program manager at the University of California, Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education. \u201cNationally about 45 percent of households have nothing saved for retirement and the median retirement account balance right now is about $3,000 at the household level. Social Security is not going to be enough.\u201d</p>, <p>The ERISA rule change had proved key to state Senate President pro Tem Kevin de Le\xf3n (D-Los Angeles) mustering legislative support for California Secure Choice. Even fervently pro-business groups within the state, like the California Chamber of Commerce and the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, eventually <a href="http://capitolweekly.net/portable-pensions-loom-historic/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">withdrew their opposition</a> to a program that sponsors reasoned could eventually save California taxpayers billions of dollars by keeping retiring workers off Medicare, food stamps and other badly strapped safety-net programs, with little risk or cost to employers.</p>, <p>Currently, the plan is scheduled to be gradually phased in until it requires all California employers with five or more employees that don\u2019t already provide a retirement plan to either begin to offer a retirement plan or provide their employees access to Secure Choice\u2019s IRA-like payroll deductions. Though individual workers may opt out, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mind-my-money/200908/opt-in-and-opt-out-pension-design" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">studies</a> have shown that automatic enrollment results in up to 90 percent higher participation than when enrollment is voluntary, particularly for low-wage workers.</p>, <p>\u201cTwo-thirds of California\u2019s small business owners support the creation of a state retirement savings program and nearly three-fourths said such a program would give their business a competitive edge,\u201d de Le\xf3n noted in an email to Capital &amp; Main.</p>, <p>One small business owner is childcare provider Nancy Harvey, who employs a small staff at Lil\u2019 Nancy\u2019s Primary Schoolhouse, which she has operated out of her West Oakland home for 15 years. Harvey, who is 54 and previously taught elementary school, explained that childcare jobs in the Bay Area typically attract workers well past retirement age.</p>, <p>\u201cPeople cannot afford to retire,\u201d she said by phone. \u201cAnd that is not a good thing when folks are taking care of children, because at some point, to be perfectly honest, it becomes a safety issue. We have providers in their 70s still providing care for children, and I\u2019m sure at some point they want to be able to retire. But because of the way the system has been set up, it just simply does not allow for that.\u201d</p>, <p>The House resolutions, if passed by the Senate and signed by President Trump, would permanently nullify the relatively obscure clarifications to ERISA that have raised the retirement-security hopes of millions of low-wage workers both inside and outside California. <a href="http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/content/states-strive-assist-private-sector-workers-without-retirement-savings" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Seven other states</a> are in various stages of creating and implementing similar state-run auto-enrollment retirement programs, including Oregon, where the <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/retire/Pages/Workers.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OregonSaves</a> payroll retirement savings plan is scheduled to go online in July.</p>, <p>No hearings are required for resolution votes and, under the Congressional Review Act, once a rule is struck down, the federal agency that issued it is barred from enacting similar regulations again in the future.</p>, <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge slap in our face,\u201d added Harvey bitterly. \u201cI feel that they just don\u2019t understand how average Americans truly live. You hate to say that it\u2019s evil-spirited, but it almost seems like it is.\u201d</p>, <p>A <a href="http://www.nirsonline.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=955&amp;Itemid=61" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">February 10 poll</a> by the nonprofit, nonpartisan National Institute on Retirement Security found that three-fourths of Americans believe that state efforts to provide working Americans access to individual retirement accounts are a good idea \u2014 up from 71 percent in 2015. It also found that the support was strongly bipartisan, with 72 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of Democrats approving of the plans across gender, income and age divisions.</p>, <p>De Le\xf3n, who personally lobbied House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield before the conservative Republican cast his vote to scuttle the rule, has vowed to press ahead with Secure Choice regardless of what Congress does. Though supporters maintain that California Secure Choice was drafted around the \u201csafe harbor\u201d already written into ERISA before the Obama rule change, de Le\xf3n has said he\u2019ll do whatever it takes to legally implement the program, including <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article131801744.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">putting it before voters</a> as a statewide ballot measure.</p>, <p>In the meantime, retirement and labor groups like AARP and Service Employees International Union Local 1000, whose president is Secure Choice oversight board member Yvonne Walker, are pulling out all the stops to see that the Republican resolutions are stopped in the Senate. (Disclosure: Walker\u2019s union is a financial supporter of this website.)</p>, <p>\u201cYou have ordinary working Americans who are faced with the choice of working until they die or retiring into poverty,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd in America, where you work hard and play by the rules, that cannot be the choice that working Americans should have to face.\u201d</p>]

It has no exceptions for rape or incest.</p>, <p>If it\u2019s passed into law, physicians could face a year in prison if they perform an abortion after a heartbeat is detected or if they fail to check for one before a procedure.</p>, <p>The measure is the most extreme abortion restriction in the country, effectively banning the procedure before most women even realize they\u2019re pregnant, pro-abortion rights advocates said.</p>, <p>\u201cAfter years of passing anti-abortion laws under the guise of protecting women\u2019s health and safety, they lay bare their true motives: to ban abortion in the state of Ohio,\u201d said Dawn Laguens, a spokesperson for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.\xa0</p>, <p>Ohio lawmakers have been <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/15/ohio-heartbeat-bill_n_3763671.html" target="_blank">trying to pass the \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d</a> since 2011,\xa0but some activists feared that it was so extreme and unconstitutional that it could lead courts to overturn other, less stringent abortion restrictions. The Supreme Court <a href="http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2016/01/arkansas-abortion-ban-supreme-court" target="_blank">refused to review</a> Arkansas\u2019 12-week abortion ban earlier this year, which lower courts had blocked. The high court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973 that states are not allowed to prohibit abortions before the fetus is viable, usually around 22 to 24 weeks into the pregnancy.\xa0</p>, <p>Republicans said they now feel emboldened to pass the bill because President-elect Donald Trump is likely to appoint anti-abortion conservatives to the Supreme Court.\xa0</p>, <p>\u201cA new president, new Supreme Court appointees change the dynamic, and there was consensus in our caucus to move forward,\u201d Ohio Senate President Keith Faber (R-Celina) <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/12/06/ohio-senate-passes-heartbeat-bill.html" target="_blank">told the Columbus Dispatch</a>.</p>, <p>The bill now moves to the desk of Gov. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/john-kasich/" target="_blank">John Kasich</a> (R).

In fact, he made a clear threat: If President </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/barack-obama/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barack Obama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u2019s administration refused to allow the merger to proceed, he wrote, Aetna would be in a worse financial position and would have to withdraw from most of its Obamacare markets, and quite likely all of them.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bertolini penned the letter, which The Huffington Post obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, on July 5 \u2015 16 days before the Justice Department announced </span><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-21/anthem-cigna-sued-by-u-s-seeking-to-block-insurer-merger"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it would fight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Humana deal. The department had asked Aetna how, if at all, a decision on the proposed merger would affect Aetna\u2019s willingness to offer insurance through the exchanges.</span></p>, <p>Bertolini responded bluntly. Aetna supported the law\u2019s goal to expand coverage and planned to increase its exchange offerings next year, in the hopes that the exchanges would stabilize as enrollment grew, he wrote.</p>, <p>But if the Justice Department were to block the merger, Bertolini warned, Aetna could no longer sustain the losses from its exchange business, forcing it to sharply change direction:</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I]f the deal were challenged and/or blocked we would need to take immediate actions to mitigate public exchange and ACA small group losses. Specifically, if the DOJ sues to enjoin the transaction, we will immediately take action to reduce our 2017 exchange footprint .... [I]nstead of expanding to 20 states next year, we would reduce our presence to no more than 10 states .\u2026 [I]t is very likely that we would need to leave the public exchange business entirely and plan for additional business efficiencies should our deal ultimately be blocked. By contrast, if the deal proceeds without the diverted time and energy associated with litigation, we would explore how to devote a portion of the additional synergies ... to supporting even more public exchange coverage over the next few years.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Obamacare critics, Aetna\u2019s retreat is proof the law is failing. To supporters, it shows the company was using its participation in Obama\u2019s signature domestic policy initiative as a bargaining chip in order to secure approval of a </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-insurance-mega-mergers-attract-powerful-enemy_us_5643a001e4b0603773477931"><span style="font-weight: 400;">controversial business deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advocates on both sides can cite at least some evidence to support their views. While </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-health-insurance_us_573a00dce4b060aa781ad6cc?7jwt7qbwozfmq85mi"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some insurers are making money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Obamacare, most of the large, publicly traded national insurers now offering coverage on the exchanges are losing money, basically for the same reasons that Aetna cites. Aetna\u2019s shift in strategy followed similar maneuvers by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unitedhealth-group-obamacare-exchanges_us_571554d9e4b0018f9cbade3b?zy7rpd6fn701cerk9"> UnitedHealth Group</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\xa0</span><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/humana-obamacare-markets-225963"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and some smaller insurers.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the exchanges do not attract more participants who are in relatively good health, then companies will likely have to keep raising rates\xa0\u2015 to the point where some people who have to pay for insurance directly, especially those who receive little or no federal subsidies, would decide it\u2019s too expensive.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, however, Anthem and Cigna, two other health insurance giants whose pending merger the Justice Department also opposes, have not said they plan to alter course on the exchanges next year, </span><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-raises-outlook-reiterates-cigna-purchase-plans-1469617063"><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite financial struggles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthem is a major player in this market segment, and Cigna intends to </span><a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160727/NEWS03/160729841/why-cigna-plans-to-sell-through-more-health-exchanges-in-2017"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer plans in more states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it currently does. Of course, investors may pressure those companies to reconsider in response to the moves by Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Aetna\u2019s posture on the exchanges changed pretty radically after the Justice Department announced that it was suing to block the Humana merger. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As recently as April, </span><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-aet-earnings-conference-205937826.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bertolini told investors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Aetna could sustain losses on the exchanges for the time being, because participation still represented a relatively cheap way to acquire new customers \u2015 particularly since the program was bound to have kinks in the early years. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bertolini defended Aetna\u2019s exchange business at the time: </span></p>, <p>We see this as a good investment, hoping that we have an administration and a Congress that will allow us to change the product like we change Medicare every year, and we change Medicaid every year. But we haven\u2019t been able to touch this product because of the politics.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since that earnings call, Aetna officials have warned that their assessment of the financial returns from the exchange business was dimming, even as the firm\u2019s other lines of business \u2015 such as employer-provided health benefits, Medicare and Medicaid \u2015 continued to thrive. On Monday, they pointed to that new information as a reason for pulling back on the exchanges.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T.J. Crawford, an Aetna spokesman, reiterated that argument in an email to The Huffington Post Tuesday. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\u201cWe gained full visibility into our second quarter individual public exchange results,\u201d Crawford wrote, \u201cwhich \u2015 similar to other participants on the public exchanges \u2015 showed a significant deterioration. That deterioration, and not the DOJ challenge to our Humana transaction, is ultimately what drove us to announce the narrowing of our public exchange presence for the 2017 plan year.\u201d</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aetna\u2019s shift in strategy, whatever the reasons, underscores </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-sign-up-deadline_us_56ac059be4b00b033aaf3eef"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the difficulties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> facing this new market for people who don\u2019t get health insurance through their employers or from a government program like Medicare and Medicaid.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The departures of health insurers from some states, along with the collapse of most of the nonprofit co-op plans created under the Affordable Care Act, also means many consumers will see fewer choices when sign-ups begin in November for 2017 coverage.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, other insurers, including </span><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/16/obamacare-is-working-for-us-says-florida-blue-ceo.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regional Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in states like Florida, Michigan and New Jersey, along with companies </span><a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/policy/medicaid-plans-succeed-obamacare-others-struggle"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Molina Healthcare and Centene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that previously specialized in covering Medicaid beneficiaries, are either</span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-health-insurance_us_573a00dce4b060aa781ad6cc?7jwt7qbwozfmq85mi"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> profitable already or say they plan to continue their investment in this market. </span></a>\xa0</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Bertolini indicated in April, strengthening these marketplaces and making coverage more secure for the low- and middle-income people who rely on it likely will require changes in the law.

Steve Pearce (R-N.M.) was originally pushing to completely defund the <a href="https://oce.house.gov/about/" target="_blank">Office of Congressional Ethics</a>, eliminating its roughly $1.4 million budget. He settled instead for a vote on an amendment to stop a $190,000 increase in OCE funding. That measure went down to defeat,\xa0270 to 137.</p>, <p>Last year, the ethics office looked into allegations of misconduct by one of Pearce\u2019s staffers. That didn\u2019t sit well with the congressman, despite the fact that the charges were ultimately dismissed. When the ethics office dismisses allegations, they remain confidential, so no one likely would have known had Pearce not made them public in his attempts to restrict the agency's authority and cut its funding.</p>, <p>Pearce said his amendment was meant to \u201cgive notice to OCE that we are watching what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p>, <p>In an brief interview with The Huffington Post after the vote, the congressman argued that the ethics office is \u201cduplicative\u201d and \u201cnot transparent.\u201d But he wouldn\u2019t say his attempts to rein in the agency were in direct response to its investigation of his staffer.</p>, <p>Rep.

That panel is run by the lawmakers themselves.</p>, <p>\u201cWe have the House Ethics Committee, and if we\u2019re not willing to do our job, then shame on us,\u201d he said.</p>, <p>Friday's vote was not Pearce's first unsuccessful stab at the Office of Congressional Ethics. Last year, he tried to <a href="https://oce.house.gov/about/" target="_blank">restrict its powers</a>\xa0by adding stringent new language to the rules governing both the OCE and the House Ethics Committee. The changes would have reaffirmed that those being investigated by the OCE can be represented by a lawyer -- <a href="http://oce.house.gov/OCE_Rules_Conduct_Investigations.pdf" target="_blank">as the rules already allowed</a> --\xa0and would have prohibited either entity from taking action that would deny a person the "right to protection provided under the Constitution."</p>, <p>The Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit government ethics group, issued a statement denouncing Pearce's latest effort.\xa0</p>, <p>"Rep.

Compared to high-profile proposals like breaking up the banks, the plan Clinton backed is a narrow change, but an important one that nerdy liberal activists have been championing for years. Put simply, Clinton wants to shift the balance of power at the Federal Reserve away from private banks in favor of democratic accountability.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fed is the most powerful economic institution in the world, and perhaps the strangest. The central bank's Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., is a government entity run by presidential appointees who must be confirmed by the Senate. But the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that perform the bulk of the central bank's grunt work -- handling and processing reserves -- are technically owned by banks. This ownership doesn't mean much in terms of direct earnings; the banks can't sell their Fed stock, and the regional Fed banks don't turn a profit. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trouble is that the regional Fed banks have a lot of power over the Federal Open Market Committee -- the key panel that sets interest rates, directing a tremendous amount of U.S. economic activity. Private banks do have a lot of influence over who manages the Fed's regional outposts through board of director positions. Directors selected by bankers help choose the president of each Fed outpost. These presidents, in turn, serve on the key committee that sets interest rates. On Thursday, Clinton called for getting bankers out of that process.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it all sounds terribly complicated, it is. But the bottom line is that Clinton called to replace one form of banker influence over public policy with a system of democratic accountability. That would be a concrete, progressive change to the status quo. And despite her rhetoric on the campaign trail,\xa0the key element of Clinton's financial platform has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to </span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-to-the-left_us_5727d46fe4b0bc9cb0445659"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implement existing law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battle between banker influence and political control at the Fed has been going on since before the central bank was even founded, as journalist and author Roger Lowenstein discusses in the latest episode of the HuffPost politics podcast "</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, That Happened</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">." Lowenstein's latest book, </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Bank-Struggle-Federal-Reserve/dp/1594205493/ref=sr_1_1?amp=&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Lowenstein+america%27s+bank&amp;qid=1463166902&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=thehuffingtop-20"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">America's Bank: The Epic Struggle To Create The Federal Reserve</span></em></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, details more than a decade of early 20th-century political combat between Democrats and Republicans, populists and progressives, agrarians and urbanites that culminated in the formation of the U.S. central bank. It sounds, in other words, quite a bit like contemporary politics -- with the caveat that Congress did actually get something done at the end.</span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"When I started this book, it was right after, in the aftermath of our most recent disaster with mortgages and bailouts and everything," Lowenstein said. "I wanted to know how we came through a somewhat similar crash a century ago without a Fed, and why it was that we didn't have one. Because even at that time, we were the only nation in the developed world that was trying to run their economy on this extreme laissez-faire basis."</span></p>, <p><strong>Listen to Lowenstein's comments in the podcast embedded above. The discussion begins at the 37:00 mark.</strong></p>, <p>Nobody in his or her right mind would design the Federal Reserve system from scratch as a way to manage the economy. And Lowenstein shows that nobody, in fact, did such a thing. Creating the Fed was both a political dogfight and a balancing act, with different factions being placated in different ways, resulting in a bizarre public-private hybrid that somehow seems to work.</p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the battle to shape the Fed didn't stop once the system got up and running. The American central bank has been overhauled several times, most notably during the Great Depression, but also during the 1980s and after the 2008 crash. </span></p>, <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinton's call for further changes is just the latest in a century of struggle over how to govern the world's most potent economic power.</span></p>]

"The next president may also nominate someone very different. Either way, our view is this: Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy."</p>, <p>Recent polls however, show that Americans largely disagree with that stance and -- with some variation -- say they want the Senate to hold hearings and consider Obama's nominee.\xa0</p>, <p>According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in early March, 63 percent of Americans agree, 44 percent strongly,\xa0<a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/washington-post-abc-news-national-poll-march-3-6-2016/1982/" target="_blank">that the Senate should hold hearings and vote on a nominee</a>. Thirty-two percent disagree and say the Senate should not hold hearings.\xa0</p>, <p>Similarly, a recent <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/poll-finds-majority-of-voters-disapprove-of-republicans-supreme-court-delay-1457499604" target="_blank">NBC/WSJ poll</a> finds that 55 percent of voters disapprove of the Senate's decision to "not consider" an Obama nominee, with 45 percent saying they strongly disapprove. Just 28 percent said they approve.\xa0</p>, <p>A plurality of respondents in the NBC/WSJ poll -- 48 percent -- say that the Senate should vote on a Scalia replacement this year. A minority of 37 percent think they should leave the position vacant and wait until next year.\xa0</p>, <p>A <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/055qdf83nv/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank">YouGov/Economist poll</a>\xa0found slightly less support, with 49 percent of Americans saying the Senate should hold hearings. One-fifth say they should not hold hearings, and one-sixth say the decision should depend on who the nominee is.</p>, <p>Although the polls do exhibit some variation -- likely because of differences in question wording -- a clear picture does emerge: Americans want Senate Republicans to hold hearings, whether the legislators approve of a nominee or not.</p>, <p>Despite an overall consensus on the issue, polls also show a clear divide along party lines. Over half of Republicans in the NBC/WSJ poll support leaving the seat open and not considering any nominations, a decision nearly 8 in 10 Democrats disapprove of.\xa0</p>, <p>Republican leadership is counting on the partisan support to carry out their plan and benefit from it come election time. Last week Politico reported the GOP leaders were circulating a poll that showed Republicans were more <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/senate-supreme-court-scalia-220552" target="_blank">worried about a liberal justice being chosen</a> than about the seat remaining open until next year.\xa0</p>, <p>However, Obama's nominee, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/03/16/126614141/merrick-garland-has-a-reputation-of-collegiality-record-of-republican-support" target="_blank">Merrick Garland, is considered to be a moderate choice</a>\xa0who has a history of Republican support and a resume that could appeal to many conservatives.\xa0</p>, <p>Furthermore, other polling conducted in the last several weeks disputes that a decision to refuse nomination hearings would be politically advantageous for Republicans in November.</p>, <p>A Quinnipiac poll finds <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-emerges-as-issue-in-ohio-senate-contest_us_56cd90fae4b041136f18d635?f3g3z0k9">a majority of voters in the swing state of Ohio</a>, where Sen.

We talked to the director of water resources, Paula Kehoe, about how the agency is enabling onsite water reuse systems, drilling new groundwater wells and achieving some of the state's lowest per capita water use.</em></p>, <p>San Francisco has an enviable <a href="http://sfwater.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=7790" rel="external" target="_blank">water system</a>. Almost completely gravity-fed, it funnels snowmelt from pristine waters high in the Sierra Nevada mountains. The water is brought to homes and businesses in San Francisco by the <a href="http://sfwater.org/index.aspx" rel="external" target="_blank">San Francisco Public Utilities Commission</a>(SFPUC), which also functions as a water wholesaler for the Bay Area.</p>, <p>About 2.6 million customers receive water from the SFPUC\u2019s system, the heart of which is the Hetch Hetchy reservoir in Yosemite National Park. Of that number, one-third are in San Francisco and the rest receive water provided by water agencies in Alameda, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.</p>, <p>It\u2019s a big system to run \u2013 the third largest in the state. To better understand its challenges and accomplishments (SFPUC has been a leader on conservation and water recycling, among other things), we spoke to Paula Kehoe, the SFPUC\u2019s director of water resources.</p>, <p><strong>Water Deeply: How has the SFPUC been weathering the drought so far?</strong></p>, <p>Paula Kehoe: Our primary water source, the Hetch Hetchy reservoir has actually performed well in the drought. And that\u2019s thanks to our storage system, which relies on a coordinated operation of all of our reservoirs. We have several reservoirs in our system, as well as a water bank account in the Don Pedro reservoir, which is downstream from Hetch Hetchy.</p>, <p>This water bank account allows us to store water in Don Pedro reservoir during wet years for future releases to local irrigation districts during dry years. This banking system allows us to store some of our precious drinking water during dry years. During this drought, we filled or nearly filled our Hetch Hetchy reservoir every year while we were drawing down our water storage bank account.</p>, <p><strong>Water Deeply: It must help that San Franciscans are generally pretty low water users, right?</strong></p>, <p>Paula Kehoe: We are also under a state mandate. Our reduction that the state assigned to San Francisco was 8 percent. In 2013 that was a challenge for us because San Francisco already uses less water than almost anyone in the state, averaging around 45 gallons per person, per day. And that is due to our conservation program that has been in place for decades.</p>, <p>We started off at a low residential per capita rate in response to the drought and we also asked our customers to help us through the drought and voluntarily reduce their consumption by 10 percent; we asked our irrigation customers to reduce their consumption by 25 percent and that was actually a mandate for those customers.</p>, <p>We put in place a number of drought restrictions and we had a tremendous response here in San Francisco. We saved 14 billion gallons of water by the end of November 2015; our goal was 10 billion gallons by December 2015, so we achieved that goal even sooner than we expected. And today our residential per capita continues to decline and we\u2019re on about 41 gallons per person per day. That is among the lowest per capita rates in the state of California.</p>, <p><strong>Water Deeply: Do you know how customers are saving water?</strong></p>, <p>Kehoe: What we plan to do [this month] is conduct a survey of San Francisco customers and consumers to find out what action they took during this drought period to really understand more about those specific actions that people took to get us down to 41 gallons per person per day.</p>, <p>And then we want to ask them if they will continue these actions and behavioral practices in the future. So we will have a better understanding of how sustainable our 41 gallons per capita is and if will we see any rebound in that. Historically, in previous droughts, we\u2019ve seen the per capita went down and there was a slight rebound but it never went back to the consumption rates we saw prior to drought periods.</p>, <p>We are happy that we live in a community where people are responding and really helping us manage our way through the drought.</p>, <p><strong>Water Deeply: What\u2019s your biggest focus right now?</strong></p>, <p>Kehoe: We are working hard on many different levels. We have a local water program here that is geared toward continuing our conservation efforts as well as developing new water supplies in San Francisco. That really provides us with additional flexibility to meet our diverse water needs by using the right type of water for the right use here in the city.</p>, <p>With our conservation program, it\u2019s been our focus for decades; since the early 1990s we have provided incentives to replace 80,000 toilets and 30,000 clothes washers, and conducted over 100,000 water audits \u2013 that really has paid off as our per capita has gone down but population has increased.</p>, <p>Really, we have seen an over 20 percent decrease in water consumption in 10 years despite modest population growth. We also have been doing studies to see how many inefficient fixtures are still left in San Francisco in homes and businesses. We completed that study and found that really our conservation programs have been so effective that we believe that 70 percent of all the toilets are water efficient. At least 50-60 percent of all residential clothes washers are efficient.</p>, <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean our job is done.</p>, <p><strong>Water Deeply: How are you working to expand the water supply?</strong></p>, <p>Kehoe: Currently we are installing new wells in San Francisco. We will have six groundwater wells in the city and we will pump that and blend it with our surface supply, which will be available day in and day out. We will be able to produce approximately 4 million gallons a day and that will increase our water supply here in San Francisco.</p>, <p>Our other focus is continuing to look at future droughts. We anticipate that we will have more droughts, so we are actively working on a project south of San Francisco by installing 13 groundwater wells to produce an additional 7 million gallons of water for drought purposes only.</p>, <p><strong>Water Deeply: You\u2019ve also done a lot with water recycling, how is that going?</strong></p>, <p>Kehoe: We know the best investment for recycled water here for us in San Francisco is to address large-scale irrigation such as parks and golf courses. Harding Park and Fleming Park golf courses currently use recycled water for their irrigation and later this year we plan to start construction on a recycled water plant on the west side of San Francisco to irrigate Golden Gate Park, Lincoln Park golf course and portions of the Presidio. That\u2019s another big focus to get that plant up and going.</p>, <p>We are also using non-potable water to clean our streets in San Francisco.</p>, <p>When it came to building our new headquarters we incorporated our own onsite water treatment system and rainwater harvesting system as well as the living machine that enables us to save 65 percent of potable water that we\u2019d otherwise be using to flush our toilets and urinals.</p>, <p>We came across a number of other developers who wanted onsite water treatment in their buildings and districts in San Francisco so we created a non-potable water program to allow that. The creation of that program really allowed us to align our governmental policies to create a process for private owners to install these systems.</p>, <p>And today we have over 40 buildings that are proposing to collect and treat their own water on site and to use that for non-potable applications such as for toilet flushing and irrigation. We\u2019ve been learning and working with others throughout the country to show that you can successfully integrate decentralized onsite water treatment systems into your broader, centralized infrastructure to reduce the use of potable water.</p>, <p><strong>Water Deeply: Are there any policy changes that you think would help?</strong></p>, <p>Kehoe: Most water issues are local. We all have different water systems. We all have different sources of water, different demands, different growth rates. Most folks are also working on developing their own local water supplies for local control and that\u2019s what San Francisco is doing and many others throughout California.</p>, <p>I think what\u2019s helpful to us is grant funding, financial assistance, state revolving fund loans that have low interest rates. Those are helpful tools to provide to the utilities who know their water systems best, know their communities best, to help them implement these kinds of projects.</p>, <p><strong>Water Deeply: You recently helped to <a href="http://www.waterdeeply.org/articles/2016/03/9743/lessons-australias-drought/" rel="external">fund a report</a>, "Managing Drought: Learning from Australia," about drought lessons in Australia. Why did you get involved in that project?</strong></p>, <p>Kehoe: We were excited about that because we wanted to learn what worked and didn\u2019t work in Australia. If there were things we could apply here. I think one of the major conclusions of the study is that conservation and demand management programs are very key to dealing with drought and to be doing those programs all along in advance. That has been San Francisco\u2019s experience. We\u2019ve been doing it for decades. It\u2019s helped us through this drought.</p>, <p><strong>Water Deeply: A lot of water agencies are having revenue problems because residents are conserving water so well \u2013 has that been an issue for you?</strong></p>, <p>Kehoe: Yes, that\u2019s the downside of folks responding to our call. Our call was to our customers and consumers to help us through this drought and they did a great job and helped us. The unfortunate part is that it does impact our revenue and that is a situation that we are dealing with and are addressing. We\u2019ve had to take some actions here. We\u2019ve had 5 percent cuts throughout the agency. We\u2019ve had to limit certain activities and things we are doing.</p>, <p>We are looking at different kinds of options, possibly revisiting our rates, although they are approved through 2017.</p>, <p><strong>Water Deeply: Anything else you\u2019d like readers to know?</strong></p>, <p>Kehoe: I think that we\u2019re all in this together. There is the role of the utility \u2013 we are developing recycled water and new groundwater projects. There is a role for consumers and customers to take on changing out their toilets and clothes washers and having efficient fixtures to help us respond to drought. There is a role for business with non-potable water programs. Developers are installing these systems. I think it\u2019s a collective and we\u2019re all working together and toward the same goal.</p>, <p>Our work is never done and that\u2019s a good thing. We are in a very uncertain time when it comes to climate and we want to be prepared for the future.</p>, <p><em>This article originally appeared on\xa0<a href="http://www.waterdeeply.org/articles/2016/03/9838/drought-proofing-san-franciscos-water-system/" target="_blank">Water <span class="il">Deeply</span></a>.\xa0<em>For weekly updates about the California drought, you can\xa0<a href="http://waterdeeply.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=8b78e9a34ff7443ec1e8c62c6&amp;id=2947becb78" target="_blank">sign up to the Water\xa0<span class="il">Deeply</span>\xa0email list</a>.</em></em></p>]
