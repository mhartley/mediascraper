Congratulated the Clinton campaign for a "pretty strong" result after Super Tuesday primaries.
Congratulated Podesta on the night of the Democratic Nevada caucus, which Clinton won.
Congratulated Podesta on White House "climate deal that you had a lot to do with."
Chit-chatted with Podesta about their shared interest in running. Harwood called Podesta his "benchmark for being in good shape."
Shared a humorous story from a book party for a former top adviser in Lyndon Johnson's White House.
Thanked Podesta for hosting an off-the-record dinner at his home three days before Clinton's campaign launch -- remarking afterward that the event was "fun."
Told Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri that they would "enjoy" an interview he conducted with Scott Walker.
Invited Podesta to lunch and dinner... And drinks. Over and over.
Boasted to Podesta that his sister-in-law was running a Colorado program to curb teen pregnancy.
Sent an email saying only "pretty funny!!" the day after Hillary's cameo on Saturday Night Live.
Speculated with Podesta whether Joe Biden would enter the Democratic primary, then gloated for correctly predicting he would not.
Told Podesta to "watch out" for Dr. Ben Carson -- warning that the Republican candidate could "could give you real trouble in a general" election.
Commended the Clinton campaign for a "strong video."
Asked Podesta his opinion on the Republican debates hosted by Fox News and Fox Business -- apparently not for any reporting on the subject.
Told Podesta that criticism of his performance as a GOP debate moderator gave him a "better appreciation of media shit-storms." He also bragged about goading Donald Trump, as moderator, into "veering off the rails."
Praised Hillary's performance at a campaign stop in Newton, Iowa.
Wrote a long note defending himself for a less-than-flattering article on Hillary, concluding: "The value of the event, to me, was seeing you guys."
Nagged Podesta for an interview with Clinton and passive-aggressively attacked the campaign for turning down his requests. Over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
Thanked Podesta personally when Clinton finally scheduled an interview for Harwood's "Speakeasy" on CNBC.
Called Hillary the "person most likely to be next president" and wondered why journalists were spending so much time on her illegal handling of classified information.,2016-11-08T09:44:14+0000

1. I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service. I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order.

2. I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.

3. I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.

4. I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.

5. I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.,2016-11-08T01:29:00+0000

Dear Establishment: 

We the People are tired of playing by the rules as you and your cronies break them to enrich yourselves. 

We are sick of you mocking us for loving our country. 

We are through with being told government handouts are the best we can hope for, that American jobs are a thing of the past. We've had enough with you cashing on broken borders and rigged trade policies that make you rich and hollow out and destroy our communities, leaving us to pick up the shattered pieces and lives. 

Establishment: We the People are done with us working folks living under one set of laws and you committing egregious crimes and never paying any price whatsoever. 

Tomorrow, win or lose, you will hear our voice. We will unite as one. And we will remain in your face and ringing in your ears until we restore the will of the People to its rightful place in our Republic.

http://trib.al/72zWM9z,My dear fellow Americans.

We are all feeling tremendous anxiety with only a few weeks left to the election. This will be the most important election in American history.

We were once a country of freedom, and now we're becoming a country of tyranny.

We are witness to our own people burning down and looting our cities. Ferguson, Missouri, Milwaukee, Orlando, Florida, Baltimore. We are all witness to our own people killing our policemen. Islamic terrorists have killed thousands of people all over our country, and Hillary and Obama want to be politically correct and pretend all the killings are not happening.

How many Americans are aware of George Soros? An evil man, who turned hundreds of Jewish people over the Nazis to be exterminated during World War II. He was interviewed on 60 Minutes, and was asked does he feel guilty for what he has done. And arrogantly, he said 'Absolutely not. If I didn't do it, someone else would have.'

Soros is a billionaire, who made most of his money manipulating currencies and almost bankrupting many countries. He supports hate groups, who are responsible for taking down our cities. And he is a close friend of Hillary Clinton, and a major supporter of her campaign.

Robert De Niro is a millionaire, as are so many of our Hollywood stars who are voting for Hillary, and who have absolutely no tolerance for anyone with a different opinion, forgetting that that is what our country is founded on: freedom of choice. But they will not be affected by Hillary's open borders. Only our poor and middle class will suffer.

Thousands of refugees will flood our nation, and no one will know the good guys from the bad guys. It will kill our economy, which is at an all-time low now under the years of Obama's presidency. And Hillary boasts of how proud she will be to continue Obama's legacy.

No one can afford health insurance now. Prices for healthcare have gone through the roof thanks to Obamacare. Our once reasonable healthcare is gone.

With Hillary as President, we will lose our Second Amendment right to bear arms. Freedom of religion will be attacked, and Hillary will try to stop all conservative voices on TV and radio. Our highest court will become Socialist, and she will restrict what America was founded on, our freedom to become a small business owner and pursue our own personal dreams.

She has blood on her hands from the Benghazi terrorist raid. Four of our American patriots died, and when the parents stood over their loved ones' coffins, she lied to them about the cause of their sons' deaths.

The pendulum of freedom is not balanced. Hillary and her followers are on a crude campaign to stop and degrade all of Trump's followers. Her words were echoed loud and clear for all Americans to hear. Hillary said Trump's followers are a basket of deplorables. They are un-redeemable.

May God protect the real truth, and may Donald Trump win this presidency. He will save our America, and he will certainly make it great again.,2016-10-14T14:16:59+0000
