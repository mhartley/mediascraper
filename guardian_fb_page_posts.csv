The report predicts a dramatic loss of healthcare coverage over the next decade if Congress enacts the Republican healthcare proposal, which has faced criticism from across the political spectrum and from nearly every sector of the healthcare industry. An estimated 52 million people would be uninsured in 2026, compared with the 28 million who would lack insurance that year under the current law, according to the report. President Donald Trump, who supports the Republican plan, has promised that his plan would provide "insurance for everybody". More: http://trib.al/Lnw1agW|2017-03-14T15:01:40+0000

Trump's secretary of health, Tom Price, made a surprising promise that "nobody will be worse off financially" under the new plan. House Speaker Paul Ryan did not deny that people could lose their insurance, but said that would be a choice left to Americans. "But we're not going to make an American do what they don't want to do," he said. "You get it if you want it. That's freedom." Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, said he wasn't sure that a nonpartisan research group charged with evaluating the plan was fit to evaluate it. Opposing the plan were fellow Republicans: senator Tom Cotton said the bill was in part too severe; Ohio governor John Kasich said it cut too many people out of Medicaid; and congressman Mark Meadows said the plan was not extreme enough. Facing off against these divisions were Democrats, itching to fight, and American voters - standing in limbo as their representatives decide the terms of how much it costs to stay healthy.

Although appointed by Barack Obama in 2009, Bharara made his name in the US's preeminent prosecutor's office with a series of corruption investigations of Democrats and Republicans alike, as well as high-profile cases on insider trading, terrorism, espionage and gangs. Unlike Sally Yates, the acting attorney general fired by Trump because she refused to defend one of his executive orders in court, Bharara's surprise dismissal followed an apparent truce between the president and the prosecutor. Last year, Bharara met with Trump and Sessions as they transitioned into office, and said he was asked to stay on in service in New York. But on day 51 of the Trump administration he was fired, prompting Bharara to tweet: "I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired. Being the US Attorney in SDNY will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life." Neither the White House nor the Justice have explained the abrupt decision to dismiss dozens of US attorneys; although new presidents normally replace most of their predecessor's pics, they sometimes do so in stages. New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, said the firing and dismissal "caused chaos in the federal government and led to questions about whether the Justice Department's vital and nonpartisan work will continue".

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unveiled two memos on Tuesday detailing wide-ranging directives focused on both interior enforcement and cracking down on security along the US-Mexico border. The memorandums would enable federal authorities to more aggressively detain undocumented immigrants, expand the pool of immigrants prioritized for removal from the country, and restrict asylum claims by migrants.

On Monday, leading Democrats were calling for Flynn to be fired over claims that he misled vice-president Mike Pence. The noncommittal update, delivered by White House press secretary Sean Spicer appeared to conflict with remarks given just moments earlier by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway who said that "General Flynn has the full confidence of the president." Earlier, Trump sidestepped questions over the issue during a brief press conference with his Canadian counterpart. Standing beside Justin Trudeau, the president took only two questions from American media: the conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group: neither asked about the controversy swirling around Flynn. Flynn could be the first major casualty of fledgling administration but others may soon follow. More: http://trib.al/V03dtzr|2017-02-14T00:37:23+0000

Oh, and an abusive remark about the pro-Clinton billionaire Mark Cuban, who for reasons that remained opaque Trump wrote was "not smart enough to run for president!" On the shows, Miller indicated a new executive order on the travel ban could be on the way and made ominous statements about the power of the judiciary. He did not defend the national security adviser Mike Flynn over his conversations with the Russian ambassador, saying only that the White House "did not give me anything to say".

"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril," he wrote. "If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!"

After a Seattle judge issued a temporary restraining order against the ban on Friday night, Trump, true to form, used Twitter to attack the judge and complain about the ruling. Some observers, and quite a few senior Democrats, said such behavior, and any government move to appeal the Seattle ruling, could precipitate full-blown constitutional crisis. Trump issued his tweets from Mar-a-Lago, his so-called "winter White House" in Florida. Protesters against the travel ban followed him there, and also marched in other cities and at airports, if in reduced numbers compared to the chaos of last week.
