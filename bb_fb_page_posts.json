This will be the most important election in American history.\n\nWe were once a country of freedom, and now we\u2019re becoming a country of tyranny.\n\nWe are witness to our own people burning down and looting our cities. Ferguson, Missouri, Milwaukee, Orlando, Florida, Baltimore. We are all witness to our own people killing our policemen. Islamic terrorists have killed thousands of people all over our country, and Hillary and Obama want to be politically correct and pretend all the killings are not happening.\n\nHow many Americans are aware of George Soros? An evil man, who turned hundreds of Jewish people over the Nazis to be exterminated during World War II. He was interviewed on 60 Minutes, and was asked does he feel guilty for what he has done. And arrogantly, he said \u2018Absolutely not. If I didn\u2019t do it, someone else would have.\u2019\n\nSoros is a billionaire, who made most of his money manipulating currencies and almost bankrupting many countries. He supports hate groups, who are responsible for taking down our cities. And he is a close friend of Hillary Clinton, and a major supporter of her campaign.\n\nRobert De Niro is a millionaire, as are so many of our Hollywood stars who are voting for Hillary, and who have absolutely no tolerance for anyone with a different opinion, forgetting that that is what our country is founded on: freedom of choice. But they will not be affected by Hillary\u2019s open borders. Only our poor and middle class will suffer.\n\nThousands of refugees will flood our nation, and no one will know the good guys from the bad guys. It will kill our economy, which is at an all-time low now under the years of Obama\u2019s presidency. And Hillary boasts of how proud she will be to continue Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\nNo one can afford health insurance now. Prices for healthcare have gone through the roof thanks to Obamacare. Our once reasonable healthcare is gone.\n\nWith Hillary as President, we will lose our Second Amendment right to bear arms. Freedom of religion will be attacked, and Hillary will try to stop all conservative voices on TV and radio. Our highest court will become Socialist, and she will restrict what America was founded on, our freedom to become a small business owner and pursue our own personal dreams.\n\nShe has blood on her hands from the Benghazi terrorist raid. Four of our American patriots died, and when the parents stood over their loved ones\u2019 coffins, she lied to them about the cause of their sons\u2019 deaths.\n\nThe pendulum of freedom is not balanced. Hillary and her followers are on a crude campaign to stop and degrade all of Trump\u2019s followers. Her words were echoed loud and clear for all Americans to hear. Hillary said Trump\u2019s followers are a basket of deplorables. They are un-redeemable.\n\nMay God protect the real truth, and may Donald Trump win this presidency. He will save our America, and he will certainly make it great again.","link":"http:\/\/trib.al\/72zWM9z","created_time":"2016-10-14T14:16:59+0000","id":"95475020353_10157898566235354"},{"message":"The latest batch of Wikileaks emails reveals further collusion between mainstream media journalists and the Hillary Clinton campaign.\n\nWe name names...","link":"http:\/\/trib.al\/gfUqksX","created_time":"2016-10-14T13:28:15+0000","id":"95475020353_10157898374820354"},{"message":"UP, not down.","link":"http:\/\/trib.al\/rNdcJyC","created_time":"2016-10-14T13:04:16+0000","id":"95475020353_10157898277210354"},{"message":"For years, stuck-up leftist media elites have sneered at and mocked conservatives for blasting bias by Establishment Media.
